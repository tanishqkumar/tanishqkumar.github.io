    <h1>Thoughts</h1>
    <p class="notop">
It's in those moments when you're walking down the street, finishing up the last set of a workout, or taking a dump, brilliance
strikes. Or, in my case, mediocrity. I have some pretty strong, certainly controversial, opinions, about things. This page documents
them, and tries to justify them to myself. The process of putting together these coherent bodies of thought forces me
to intimately grapple with the likely possibility that my contrarian thoughts are just wrong. If you're reading this
and disagree with anything I say, <a href="mailto:tanishq@careerfear.org">please tell me!</a> I love to change my mind.<br><br>

<h3>What I'm Doing During My Gap Year</h3>
<p class="notop">

Taking a gap year, in the sense that 95% of people do, is in my opinion a complete waste of time and money. I was never considering
taking a gap year until my father mentioned it in passing one day. Listening to him explain how it could help me "see the world through a differen lens"
made me want to laugh. Reflecting on my time at high school though, I found that I learned and grew the most when left to my own devices,
when given the autonomy to make decisions about what I thought I should learn or try. And when asking myself why I wasn't taking a gap year
in the first place, the only compelling answer I could conjure up was the "it wasn't the beaten path". Gap years were for people
who didn't get into college the first time--right? Unless they weren't.
<br><br>
Before I knew it, I was curled up in my bed, furiously shaking the last few drops of ink out of a dark blue ball points, biting at it's
top as I grappled with what I'd make of the year ahead. A good starting point was to see what others did. I was disappointed. Most people
did tokenist volunteer work--the kind that feels like it's life-changing while you're doing it but 2 weeks after you get back to your
comfy home, the experience is little more than a resume bullet point, leaving the very people you were helping just as
powerless as before. Alternatively, many others would they just travel around to different countries learning languages. At this point,
I was fluent in 3 languages, and didn't thinking language-learning, in general, was a great time investment. People do business in English
around the world, and many countries won't take you seriously just because they can tell you're a foreigner no matter how well you
speak their language. To locals, it seems cute, at best, and is utterly useless, at worst. With those two common themes off the table,
what else was there to do?
<br><br>
Searchingly planning out what I'd do in the years after my gap gave me the answer to that questions. Did I want to be a surgeon, like my father?
Perhaps work on Wall Street, living a comfortable and "prestigious" life, like so many others that walk the Harvard path. Or
parrot out condescensions towards those that "sold themselves out", convincing myself that I would do something more "meaningful"?
Daydreaming, I thought back to when I was young. As a little person, I always thought that society would hand-pick the best, the brightest,
and pit them against humanity's biggest challenges. If you were "special" enough to attend an elite school, you had greatness
stamped onto your destiny; you'd give up your life tackling climate change, curing cancer, exploring Mars. Right? Wrong. As I grew up,
I witnessed the best and brightest flock to optimise ads for a search engine, or take clients out to ritzy hotels and expense
it under the firm's name.
<br><br>
But it didn't have to be that way. I'm trying to help build that world I wanted to grow up in. And that meant that if I was in fact
part of the esoteric "best and brightest", I had a duty to pit myself against the world's most pressing challenges. But what were those?
Stepping back, I thought about industries, problems, themes that would be indisputably important in our species' future. Climate change was
something we'd have to tackle sooner or later. And that required a rewiring of the world's energy infrastructure. So I made a note of those.
<br><br>
And what about meaning? Future generations would want to find meaning in a life where all our mundane tasks, like doing taxes and
constructing buildings, were encoded away to machines. I thought back to how technology might help people derive a sense of purpose
in life. If you've ever been addicted to a video game, you know how you can wake up, start playing, and realise it's midnight before
you know it. Gaming, I convinced myself, was going to become more immersive and detailed as the technology powering game engines
advanced. Virtual, augmented reality, would change the way we interact with our world. We didn't have to
travel to France or Japan in real life, we merely had to convince our mind that we were doing so. And that was
something immersive video games could do. That was another industry to watch.
<br><br>
But how do we guarantee technological progress happens at this fast rate I've assumed? How do we know future generations will be
as ambitious, conniving, hopeful as we are? We must educate them. When I could learn more self-studying over a summer than I could in two
years of high school, it was clear something was wrong. And my work in education equity with CareerFear has bound me to a core belief that the annals of history will most clearly remember not individual achievements, but generational strides: the kind that only come about when everyone is equipped to contribute.
Could technology make education more personal? More accessible? That was another question I wanted answered.
<br><br>
And these are just industries I've had some exposure to. What are some enormous industries that I'd never had any exposure to?
Well, how about the industry supported by the biggest financial institutions on Earth? Governments themselves. Military and defense
budgets are <i>quite literally </i> orders of magnitude larger than most other industries. They're just more stealthy. Which kid
grows up wanted to build weapons and technology that governments rely on? But that's the very predicate on which our planet's peace
is built--mutually assured destruction. Add that industry to the list.
<br><br>
And finally, I'd always had a childhood fascination with architecture. Perhaps it was a Indian kids way of rebelling
against his parents, who so conspicuously were nudging him towards STEM, to talk about the beauty in buildings as permanent structures
that are living monuments embodying their architect's will. To quip that I'd pursue a career
in art. What would buildings look like in the future? More generally,
what would <i> cities </i> look like in the future? How would technology change the way we interact with our urban environments,
and how did that interplay with our struggles with global warming and mobility?
<br><br>
So I had my list. I wanted to spend a sizeable portion of the year learning about these 5 industries: energy & climate, agriculture & the environment,
defense & military, education, gaming/media, and urban technology. All through a lens of how technology and computer science could
transform these fields. These were fields that could conceivably change the world, but fields that I would never otherwised be exposed to.
I would have plenty of time in Boston to learn about fintech and biotech, but when would I seriously think about feeding the planet,
autonomous weapons, or machine learning as an educational tool? Never, unless I took this year to do exactly that.
<br><br>
Originally, I hoped to work for two months in each of these industries. Quickly, I spotted a flaw in my reasoning. How much would I really
learn working at some low-level position doing some repetitive, mundane task, several layers under a boss who was the one that I'd really get
to learn from. Instead, it made more sense to learn about these the way I'd learn anything else--by reading, and talking to
smart people working in the industries. So everyday, for 3 hours, I read about one of these industries, make notes,
and meet engineers, entrepreneurs, academics working in these spaces from time to time, picking their brain about what they think
the future of their industry is.
<br><br>
But what about the other 21 hours a day? Let's say I slept for 8-9 of them, and spent 1-2 cooking, cleaning, and generally
adulting. I had around 10 to play with. What to do? Well, if I found an industry I was interested in, I might conceivably come across
an interesting business idea while in college. After all, the 4 years you spend in college are around brilliant, ambitious peers,
enormously intelligent and accomplished professors, and the university handing you money for your projects on a platter. What better
place to change the world? But if I was going to transform energy technology, game technology, or any other technology, I needed to
be a technologist. <br><br>Unfortunately, a rudimentary understanding of C++ wasn't going to cut it. I needed to immersively
lose myself in a crucible of tech, and come out with the ability to build out any idea I had--whether that was a web app (like Facebook),
mobile app (like Uber), or more complicated software (like Microsoft).
<br><br>
But Tanishq--you learn all that during college anyways. That's the point of a CS degree, right? <br><br>No. Wrong. Categorically incorrect.<br><br>
I thought so too. In fact, computer science, as colleges teach it, and software engineering--the act of building the products
we use on a daily basis, have relatively little overlap. This stunned me, and it should shock you too.
When I spoke to software engineers, they told me that their jobs involved 1 or 2 courses from college,
and the rest was things they learned during internships--stuff like using programming frameworks (Django, React, etc.),
getting accustomed to programming systems (i.e. writing lots of code), and studying engineering best practices (learning on the job).
<br><br>
That sealed the deal. The bulk of my day would be spent learning software engineering. How? Maybe an intensive bootcamp? Maybe by
getting a job as a software engineer? Well, to get a job, you have to know how to do it. And bootcamps were educational institutions,
no matter how intense they claimed to be, I was sure I could do it better, faster, myself. And so I lined up some online courses,
a bunch of projects I wanted to build, and got to work. This takes up around 6 hours of my day.
<br><br>
In the end, it seems backwards. I'm taking a year out to...learn programming and read? <i><strong>Isn't that exaclty what a college degree in CS would
teach you? <br><br></i></strong><img src="/static/meme1.jpg" height="200" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><br><br>
 I'm convinced this is the sort of pattern-matching thinking that
leads people astray in the first place. When you dig into the details, you see that the programming I'm doing is preparation
to build useful, marketable products, not prove abstract computational theorems (a CS degree), and the reading I'm doing
is about the future of industries I may very well end up working in, not grappling with esoteric philosophical prose (the kind
you do a lot of in college). Not to say those things aren't important--they have their place, and I'll make sure to do them
when I'm in college. But before I get there I need to know how to be useful first. So I'm sorting that out.
<br><br>
And in the evenings, I breakdance.
