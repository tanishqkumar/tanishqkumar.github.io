    <h1>Thoughts</h1>
    <p class="notop">
It's in those moments when you're walking down the street, finishing up the last set of a workout, or taking a dump, that brilliance
strikes. I have some pretty strong, certainly controversial, opinions. This page documents and justifies
 them. The process of putting together these coherent bodies of thought forces me
to intimately grapple with the likely possibility that my contrarian thoughts are just wrong. If you're reading this
and disagree with anything I say, <a href="mailto:tanishq@careerfear.org">please tell me!</a> I love to change my mind.<br><br>

<h3>On the Financial Institution</h3>
<p class="notop">
<i>
Westminster and Harvard both have significant pull towards finance--whether that's at a bulge bracket investment bank (think Goldman Sachs), quantitative hedge fund (think Two Sigma), or fintech startup (think Addepar).
When all your most ambitious and accomplished peers are being sucked into an industry like specks of dust unthinkingly marching up a vacuum's long snout, you can't help but wonder what's so great about the industry in the first place. </i>
<br><br>
At the highest level of abstraction, the financial institution exists to allocate capital efficiently so society can be optimally productive. And, most of the time, it does exactly that. The big banks--yes, the very same ones that are so often vilified by miseducated members of the public--exist simply to help organisations raise capital from people that want to invest. In my opinion, they do this very well.
So much so that the US government bailed out the big banks in the wake of the 2008 crisis because the government recognized that the economy would collapse without them. If no investment banks remained, who would give companies--both big and small--access to public capital? Companies would go bankrupt, millions would be laid off. Disaster. By taking money from taxpayers at the time, the US government funded the survival of some of the big banks,
thereby stabilising the immediate economic future of American society (but also thereby incentivising bad behaviour).
<br><br>
The reason that claims about the value of (investment) banking as an industry seem so political is because even though objective facts about the importance of the industry's role exist, they are <i> incredibly complex</i>.
Perhaps an example will help. Let's say we're debating, say, whether new regulations after the 2008 crisis removed bad actors in the banking industry. Many economists will do deeply researched studies, using advanced models, and come to a conclusion
 that the regulations were, in fact, effective. Looking carefully, we find that herein lies the problem. <i>Equally reputable economists will do studies a slightly different—-but equally valid—-way and come out with the <strong>opposite </strong>conclusion</i>, giving both sides "facts" to fuel their respective fires.
<br><br>
  The ex-banker I spoke to—-who inspired this piece—-confessed that he left because he didn’t find the work meaningful. The main reason that so many people hate on banking as an industry is not because of bad actors (people embezzling funds/overcharging management fees).
  Sure, these people exist, but they are no more common than in any other industry. In fact, what many people fail to internalise is that most financial products/services are based on complex, but very sound, mathematics and robust legal architecture--even if it, at times, seems unecessarily convoluted.
  Let me restate that for emphasis. The financial products and services people in Silicon Valley find confusing and nebulous are often very effective, well-researched, vehicles to efficiently allocate society's capital.
  The reason people hate banks (and the only justifiable one), is instead that they exist to help the rich get richer. In this sense, the banks aren’t directly doing good for the bottom 99%.
<br><br>
  The CFO of, say, Walmart, who wants to raise capital for a new service Walmart is looking to implement, or, say, a $4B startup looking to IPO, clearly think Goldman is worth the $10M fee they’re charging for their M&A/fundraising services, or else the companies wouldn’t pay it. And for the investors/execs at these big companies that stand to make a lot of money when stock prices rise after funds are raised, going with Goldman certainly is worth the $10M. <i>So both the bank and client come </i> out ahead.  No one seems to get “screwed”.<strong> Except, of course, the naïve member of the public</strong>, who invests in the company looking to raise money without knowing all the facts. It’s<i>their</i> money that gets channeled into the executives’/investors' pockets (there is, after all, only a finite of capital that exists in society). But, of course, the layperson volunteered to invest their money; no-one forced them to do it. They just didn’t have an "edge" when betting on the market, and so lost their money. Then complained about it, and scapegoated the "evil corporates". It should be noted that there exceptions, of course—-members of the public didn't necessarily make misinformed investments when it came to the 2008 housing bubble, that really was down to miscalculations and greed on behalf of the banks.
<br><br>
  And now to tackle a common misconception: some think that employees benefit when companies raise capital. This is not the case. When a company, say Walmart, raises money, its 2.7 million employees do NOT all get a raise, or more perks. Their professional lives are left unchanged. The only argument that can even be <i> attempted </i> by the aspiring
  banker is that fuelling companies by supplying them with access to capital means that they can provide more value for their customers. More concretely put, if, say, Walmart raises $2B from investors in a transaction mediated by JP Morgan,
  it can use that money to kickstart that new autonomous 1-day delivery service that will then add convenience to millions of Americans and add value to <i> those </i> lives. My response to this argument is: no shit, that's the point of raising capital in the first place. This argument, while undeniably true,
  emphasises value-added that is, in my opinion, too far removed from the everyday human to be clearly meaningful work. The work of individual analysts at JPM and the implementation of the autonomous delivery service are many steps removed from each other, and it's difficult to know if any individual banker had a meaningful role to play
  in the whole arc at all.
<br><br>
  The dull reality is that most bankers are cogs in a machine that is--at best, contributing value that is several steps removed from wider society (like the JPM-Walmart-delivery service), and at worst, actively screwing over millions (like the 2008 crisis). Perhaps
  this becomes more apparent as you begin to bear children of your own. At this point, you start to think more carefully about the effects your actions have on other people; people like your tender, starry-eyed children. Perhaps that's why so many people leave banking with a bad taste in their
  mouths around the ages of 40-50, right as their children hit adolescence and their own futures are financially secure.

<h3>Hard Work vs Discipline</h3>
<p class="notop">
  It's 5am. You jolt awake, exasperated. Frustrated, angry, that you--only 7 hours ago--would have the audacity
  to force your present self out of deep, peaceful sleep. But you're proud that you're up. You don't spend your usual
  30 minutes scrolling mindlessly on Instagram like you're in a semi-comatose state. You're on a mission. Even on the way to the bathroom to brush your teeth,
  you walk with a purpose, as if steadying yourself to begins sprinting in the direction of your dreams. An hour later, you find your
  citrus Nike tee soaked by fruits of your workout.
<br><br>
  Readying yourself for school, you pull your charcoal socks up to the middle of your shin like an athlete deep in focus, religiously lacing up before an
  Olympic final. While others frolick playfully in the dining hall, you give up your lunchtimes to work. After school,
  you lose yourself once again in the deep waters of focus. Only when the sun sets again at dusk do you hesitantly--as if glancing to your left and right before beginning to cross a busy intersection--take a breather. You're exhausted.
  But you've prayed to mantras of "grinding" and "outworking" too long;
  this is not when you let up. Another motivational video pushes you through yet another hour of bleary eyed study. As your city
  slips into the depths of darkness, you do too. Then you do it all over again.
<br><br>
  Welcome to the grind.
<br><br>
  This was my life for two years. In Year 11 and 12 (sophomore & junior year) of high school, I was obsessed. Obsessed with
  getting into Westminster as a way to escape the shackles of a mediocre education, obsessed with academically matching
  the very best in the world.
  To a weary but hopeful mid-teen, the phrase "hard work" was more than another empty truism. It was a lifestyle. I thought
  I was a demi-god, subtly fabricating excuses for missing friends' parties--as if my
  paternal grandfather really <i> was </i> in town for his knee surgey--only to spend quiet Friday evenings at my desk,
  in the depths of concentration. I don't know what I was looking to prove. Perhaps it was a former debater trying to convince himself
  that he was more than just an articulate speaker, that he could compete with the strongest math/science
  students on Earth. Perhaps it was
  an anxious teen at a competitive high school, refusing to "settle" when applying to college.
<br><br>
  What I <i> do </i> know is that I wasn't working the right way. Sure, I got a lot done. Through brute force,
   I completed 2 A-levels in 5 weeks during summer. I scaled an education equity nonprofit while
  sipping undergraduate biology on the side.
<br><br>
  But now, at 18, I look back and cringe. I'm disappointed that I ever really believed that
  "hard work" was what forged greatness. That becoming great at whatever you did necessarily meant devoting every waking hour,
  feeling socially asphixiated, giving up so many things you love, pushing your body to its physical limits.
<br><br>
  How childish.
<br><br>
  Some of you may be shaking your head, curious as to where exactly that logic breaks down. We see Musk touting his 100-hour work week, athletes
  doing nothing but train all day on TV. This is what the world has always said. So, surely, "hard work", does
  in fact mould champions.
<br><br>
  Nope.
<br><br>
  I'll tell you what <i> does</i>. Output. Getting very important things done. Productivity. Putting in enormous amounts of time
  has little bearing on how much you accomplish. This is an empirical observation.
<br><br>
  But how can that be? The more hours you pour into something, the better you'll be. Right? Right. <i>If, and only if,</i> you hold
  intensity (how much you achieve in every hour spent working) constant. In reality, those hours I was awake at 5am, working for two hours before school, I achieved almost nothing.
  I could barely focus. Bleary eyed, I'd stare blinkingly at textbooks, blindly trying to
  retain material like my mom trying desperately to hold up a mountain of clothes at a thrift shop, only to clasp helplessly
   as they fall by the wayside. The amount of work I got done in those 120 minutes was equivalent to around 30 minutes of
  deep, focused work at my peak.
<br><br>
  And to get to that peak consistently, I needed 9+ hours of sleep (personal observation). I needed to hang out with friends.
  And so as I grew older and--allegedly--wiser, I turned in my obsession with "hard work" and motivational videos for something far more nuanced.
  Discipline. During my gap year, I get 11 hours of sleep a night (the natural amount I sleep without setting an alarm), with no regrets.
  What I do make sure to do, however, is to have <i> habits </i> in place to make sure that, during the 13 hours I <i>am</i> awake,
  shit gets done. I split my day into three chunks. 4 hours spend coding, 4 hours spend reading, and 2 hours spent breakdancing.
<br><br>
  Let me clarify. It takes me 6 hours to put in those 4 hours writing code. By 4 hours coding, I really mean 4 hours spent, butt-in-chair,
  focused while typing furiously at the keyboard. I set a timer, and stop it every time I go to the toilet. Every time I get water.
  Every time I take a 10 minute break. And so ultimately, to excise those 8 hours of productivity every day, I have to spend 11-12 hours "working".
<br><br>
  And I'm seeing progress like never before. In 1 hour of silent, uninterrupted work, I can lose myself in the deep waters of focus.
  I get more done in an hour now than in almost a whole day of maniacal "hard work". And I advise you to do the same. Like a sinner
  worriedly creeping into a place of worship, seeking impunity, turn in your childish obsession with "hard work". Supplant it with a more
  mature understanding of the power of discipline and habit. The power of keeping to rituals, and hitting realistic daily goals.
  Every. Single. Day. Hitting the 4-4-2 target 90% of the time is <i>far</i> more productive than consistently
  getting only 50% use out of 16-hour-workdays, no matter how hard Elon Musk says he's working.
<br><br>
  Don't get me wrong. When I'm working on my PhD thesis, or about to pitch for Series A for a startup, I will have to work hard AND
  be disciplined. There are moments in life where you should sacrifice your social life and health for peak intelletual performance.
  At those points, I will have to regularly execute 16-hour-days at 100% efficiency. But I cannot do that
  for years on end. Anyone who says they can is lying to you. In those 16 hours, they probably get 8-9 hours of real work done, just
  as I do.
<br><br>
  Except, of course, I do it while sleeping 11 hours a day :)

<h3>What I'm Doing During My Gap Year</h3>
<p class="notop">

I opted to take a gap year only weeks before being supposed to start at Harvard. Laughing, always, listening to my father first suggest the idea, and explain how it could
help me "see the world through a different lens" made me cringe. Mulling over it, though, I did learn and grow the most when left to my own devices;
when I was given the autonomy to make decisions about what <i>I thought </i>I should learn or try, and how I should learn it. And when asking myself why I wasn't taking a gap year
in the first place, the only compelling answer I could conjure up was the "it wasn't the beaten path". Not very convincing.
<br><br>
Before I knew it, I was curled up in my bed like a hot dog in a big ol' bun, furiously shaking the last few drops of ink out of a dark blue ball point, biting at it's
top as I grappled with what I'd make of the year ahead. I felt like an artist lost in thought, paralysed the myriad stories he might tell
through the medium of his starchy white canvas. A good starting point was to see what others did during their gap years.
<br><br>I was disappointed.
<br><br>
Most people did tokenist volunteer work--the kind that feels like it's life-changing while you're doing it but 2 weeks after you get back to your
comfy home in a developed country, is little more than a resume bullet point, leaving the very people you were "helping" just as
powerless as before you visited them. Volunteering? Cross that one off the list. Others would travel, experience culture, and learn languages. At this point,
I was fluent in 3 languages, had grown up living on almost every continent on Earth. I didn't think learning languages, in general,
was a great time investment. People do business in English around the world, and locals in many countries won't take you seriously
because they can tell you're a foreigner no matter how well you speak their language. To them, it seems cute, at best, and is utterly useless, at worst.
<br><br>
Others take gap years to work, to make some money, or to "take a breather". Many people who work during their gap years come from backgrounds where they
genuinely need to contribute to help support their families and pay for college. I admire and deeply respect those people.
Many others, however, don't think very critically about which job they're doing, and end up learning very little, as well as earning very little.
They would've been far better off adding 1 more year of work <i> after </i> a college degree. And as for those "taking a breather", I'm sure they have their reasons,
but I didn't want my year to take away from the early intellectual momentum I'd built up in the last few years of high school.
I wanted it to be my most intense year yet. I concluded that around 90% of people who take a gap year would've been better off without one.
But for the 10% that make full, deliberate use of every day of that year, and the flexibility that comes with it? It changes their life. With the most common things to
do during a gap year off the table, <i>what would I actually do, though</i>?
<br><br>
Searchingly reflectng on the years after college gave me my answer. Did I want to be a surgeon, like my father?
Perhaps work on Wall Street, living a comfortable and "prestigious" life, like so many others that walked the Harvard path. Or
parrot out condescensions towards those that "sold themselves out", convincing myself that I would do something more "meaningful"?
<br><br>
Daydreaming, I thought back to when I was young. As a little person, I always thought that society would hand-pick the best, the brightest,
and pit them against humanity's biggest challenges. If you were "special" enough to attend an elite school, you had greatness
stamped onto your destiny; you'd give up your life tackling climate change, curing cancer, exploring Mars, all for
the betterment of your species, right? Wrong. As I grew up,
<i>I witnessed the best and brightest flock to optimise ads for a search engine, or spend 80 hours a week mindlessly filling in Excel
  spreadsheets for their bulge-bracket employer.</i>
<br><br>
But it didn't have to be that way. If I wanted to live in that world, I better help build it. And that meant that if I aspired to be
part of this esoteric "best and brightest", I had a duty to put my money where my mouth was, and pit
myself against the world's most pressing challenges.<br><br>
But what were they?
<br><br>
Stepping back, I meandered through industries, problems, themes that would be indisputably important in our species' future. For starters,
climate change was a planet-scale problem we'd have to tackle sooner or later. That was for sure. And solving that required a
rewiring of the world's energy infrastructure, a multi-trillion dollar industry. I made a note of those, as industries that piqued my interest.
<br><br>
And what about meaning? Future generations would want to find meaning in a life where all our mundane tasks, like doing taxes and
constructing buildings, were encoded away to machines. I thought back to how technology might help people derive a sense of purpose
in life. If you've ever been addicted to a video game, you know how you can wake up, start playing, and realise it's midnight before
you know it. Gaming, I convinced myself, was going to become more immersive and detailed as the technology powering game engines
advanced. Virtual, augmented reality, may change the way we interact with our world. We didn't have to
travel to France or Japan in real life, we merely had to convince our mind that we were doing so. And that was
something immersive video games could do. Another industry to watch.
<br><br>
But how do we guarantee technological progress happens at this fast rate I've assumed? How do we know future generations will be
as ambitious, conniving, hopeful as we are? We must educate them. When I could learn more self-studying over a summer than I could in two
years at the most academically elite high school in the world, it was clear something was wrong. And my work in education equity with CareerFear has bound me to a core belief that the annals of history will most clearly remember not individual achievements, but generational strides: the kind that only come about when everyone is equipped to contribute.
Could technology make education more personal? More accessible? At scale? That was another set of questions I wanted answered. Add edtech to the list.
<br><br>
And these are just industries I've had some exposure to. What are some enormous industries that I'd never had any exposure to?
Well, how about the industry supported by the biggest financial institutions on Earth? Governments themselves. Military and defense
budgets are <i>quite literally </i> orders of magnitude larger than most other industries. They're just more stealthy. Which kid
grows up wanted to build weapons and technology that governments rely on? But that's the very predicate on which our planet's peace
is built--mutually assured destruction. Add that to the list.
<br><br>
And finally, I'd always had a childhood fascination with architecture. Perhaps it was my way of rebelling
against my parents, who so conspicuously were nudging me towards careers in STEM, to half-threaten them with a career in architecture.
Stunning structures like the Burj Khalifa or Golden Gate Bridge would always leave me spellbound. It begged the question:
what would buildings look like in the future? More generally, what would <i> cities </i> look like in the future? Why are we
trying to make autonomous vehicles instead of more walkable cities? How would technology change the way we interact with our urban environments,
and how did that interplay with global warming and mobility?
<br><br>
So I had my list. I wanted to spend a sizeable portion of the year learning about these 6 industries: energy/climate, agriculture/environment,
defense/military, education, gaming/media, and urban/transport technology. All studied through a lens of how software and algorithms could
transform these fields. The goal was the find problems I could spend my college education--or, indeed, a lifetime--solving. These were fields
that could conceivably change the world--and be profitable--but fields that I would never otherwised be exposed to.
I would have plenty of time in Boston to learn about fintech and biotech, but when would I seriously think about feeding the planet,
autonomous weapons, or machine learning as an educational tool? <strong> Never</strong>, <i>unless I took this year to do exactly that.</i>
<br><br>
Originally, I hoped to work for two months in each of these industries, as an intern. Quickly, I spotted a flaw in my reasoning. How much would I <i>really</i>
learn about energy working as a software engineer at an energy-tech company? Talking to employees convinced me that the answer was very little.
For example--building a front-end dashboard to display key metrics is fundamentally the same task, no matter if it's a dashboard for an energy company to look at how their oil drills are doing,
or a biotech company to understand how their drugs are working. Instead, it made more sense to learn about these industries the way I'd learn anything else
--by carefully reading books, scouring the internet, and talking to smart people working in these industries. So everyday, for 4 hours, I read and make notes,
I meet engineers, entrepreneurs, academics working in these spaces from time to time, picking their brain about what they think
the future of their industry is. Nothing has been as rewarding as reading <i> with a purpose. </i>
<br><br>
But what about the other 20 hours a day? Let's say I sleep for 9 of them, and spend 1-2 cooking, cleaning, and generally
adulting. I have around 9 more to play with. What to do? Well, if I found an industry I was interested in, I might conceivably come across
an interesting business idea while in college. After all, the 4 years you spend in college are around brilliant, ambitious peers,
enormously intelligent and accomplished professors, and the university handing you money for your projects on a platter. What better
place to change the world? But if I'm going to transform energy technology, game technology, or, indeed, any other technology, I need to
be a technologist. <br><br>Sadly, high school programming won't cut it. I need to immersively
lose myself in a crucible of tech, and come out with the ability to build out the prototype for any idea I had--whether that was a web app (like Facebook),
mobile app (like Uber), or more complicated software (like Microsoft's Windows). Think of how Gates and Zuckerberg had put in thousands of hours
<i>mastering</i> programming before they even set foot on the Harvard campus.
<br><br>
<i><strong>But Tanishq--you learn all that during college anyways. That's the point of a CS degree, right?</i></strong>
<br><br>No. Wrong. Categorically incorrect.<br><br>
I thought so too. In fact, computer science, as colleges teach it, and software engineering--the act of building the products
we use on a daily basis--have relatively little overlap. This stunned me, and it should shock you too, since most students decide to study
CS not because they want to learn about the central tenets of computational complexity, but because they want to be employed as software engineers afterwards.
When I spoke to software engineers, they told me that their jobs involved <i>only 1 or 2 courses from college</i>,
and the rest was things they learned during internships--stuff like using programming frameworks (Django, React, etc.),
getting accustomed to designing systems (writing lots of code), and studying engineering best practices (learning on the job).
<br><br>
That sealed the deal. The bulk of my day would be spent learning software engineering. How? Maybe an intensive bootcamp? Maybe by
getting a job as a software engineer? Well, to get a job, you have to know how to do it. And bootcamps were educational institutions,
no matter how intense they claimed to be, I was sure I could do it better, faster, myself. And so I lined up some online courses,
a bunch of projects I wanted to build, and got to work. This takes up around 6 hours of my day.
<br><br>
At first glance, it really does seem backwards. I'm taking a year out to...learn programming and read? <i><strong>Isn't that exactly what a college degree,
  majoring in CS, would teach you?<br><br></i></strong><img src="/static/meme1.jpg" height="200" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><br>
 I'm convinced this is the sort of pattern-matching thinking that
leads people astray in the first place. When you dig into the details, you see that the programming I'm doing is preparation
to build useful, marketable products, not prove abstract computational theorems (a CS degree). The reading I'm doing
is about the nitty-gritty details of industries I may very well end up working in, not grappling with esoteric literature (the kind
you do a lot of in college). Let me be explicit--I am not saying these things aren't important. In a world increasingly
using technology as a crutch, understanding the central philosophies and concepts of human thought is more important now than ever before. I will make sure to do these things
when I'm in college. But before I get there I need to know how to be useful first. So I'm taking a year to sort that out.
<br><br>
And in the evenings, I breakdance.
<br><br>

<h3>Great Expectations</h3>
<p class="notop">

The question I will attempt to answer in this piece is a simple one: <i>what makes great institutions great?</i> This refers to high schools,
universities, big-corporates, sports teams, and even, say, royal dynasties. But the focus will be on educational institutions, informed,
inevitably, by my experience at Westminster and the things I hear when talking to friends currently at Harvard. <i>But the
  principles I derive apply to the Golden State Warriors as much as they do to MIT;
  to the Navy SEALs and Phillips Exeter Academy, in equal measure.</i>
<br /><br />
Let me be explicitly clear; there are a few things that <strong>do not</strong> confer greatness upon an institution of learning. Wealth, for starters.
Quality of facilities--of faculty, even. Connections. Brand name. All of these help, sure, but only a little bit.
In my opinion, they don't really address the heart of what makes these legendary institutions capable of so routinely
pumping out visionaries--the kind of people who are unafraid to mould history with their bare, gritty hands. It comes down to three things: <strong>peer-teaching,
recalibrating expectations, and a sense of entitlement.</strong>
<br /><br />
Let's start with the first one. Groggy, at 1am one night snuggled up in your memory-foam mattress you find yourself once again
in a weird corner of YouTube; this time you're half-awake, blinking unthinkingly, staring at "What do Harvard students like MOST about Harvard"?
You hear one phrase, again and again. And then some more, pummelled until it loses every ounce of meaning. "The people".
<br /><br />
What exactly do they mean by this?
<br /><br />
I don't even think the Harvard students really know the answer to that. And that is that the most important learning that happens at
Harvard, Westminster, or any other great institution, isn't the kind that happens in class or the lecture hall. No; that's a mere formality.
A sham, if you will. The real learning happens in dorm rooms at 3am, when casual midnight chit-chat about the protests
in Hong Kong spiral into a lengthy argument with your roomate--who happens to be the leader of the 2014 Hong Kong student protests--
who explains, through a mouth over-stuffed with melting chocolate chips, the nuances of east-Asian politics, as the insiders know it.
The real learning happens when you just got back from a golf tournament and you're in your dorm room blasting Kanye.
A friend walks in, in his shorts and mildly creepy stubble, to, as they say, "shoot the shit". You talk about your futures over simmering
sausage pizza, and he (with a surprisingly sardonic smile on his face) confesses that the real reason he wants to be an investment banker is
because he's hooked on his family's 7-figure lifestyle, and wants to enjoy decades of the finer things in life, like "hookers and coke".
<br /><br />
You laugh, but it keeps you up at night. Not because it was startlingly avaricious (though it was),
but because he's ahead of you in knowing exactly what makes him happy. You can't quite formulate
an answer with the same certainty, and that <i>terrifies you</i>. The real learning happens when you're sitting down for lunch with a new girl you just met, exchanging
pleasantries and small-talk, only to have to spend a few seconds after the conversation scanning the floor for the jaw you dropped
 after you find out that she cured a rare type of pancreatic cancer in high school. You learn about the economics of oncology--
something you had, quite literally, never spent a second thinking about--over budget meatballs and staling rice.
<br /><br />
These casual conversations add up. Years after you graduate, you forget how to derive Maxwell's equations and the
characteristic themes of medieval English literature. But you don't forget those meandering chats that left you stunned,
and a little wiser. You collect and cherish these back-and-forths--no; hoarde them, as if they're rare gems glittering in the dust of your memory.
You are right to do so, because they are. For these are the breakfast debates and seaside reflections that laid the seams for the person
you grew up to become.
<br /><br />
But there's more to peer-education. Just as the sands of time relentlessly wear at your memory of Euclid's algorithm or
understanding of consumer surplus, they eat away at the details that made those casual conversations so magical in the first place, too.
That's alright, though, because the peer-education wasn't the most important part of your interactions with other students. And this gets
at the core of what I believe <i>really</i> makes institutions great. They recalibrate your expectations. They take what you think and know and
believe to be "normal" and "usual" and they beat it to the ground. <i></i>They bruise and batter and dismantle and rewire, bit by bit,
your expectations.<i></i> By this, I mean that <strong>they make the sensational seem pedestrian.</strong> This is how schools like Harvard become
crucibles of greatness, furnaces that take bronze, smelt it and break it down, and forge it into something shinier and stronger.
When Joshua Wang or David Hogg is your roommate, activism isn't so unique anymore. When you've seen Yo-Yo Ma
drunk at a frat party, he's not a "prodigious musician" to you anymore, just another goofy friend. When you go out on a date with
Malia Obama, celebrity appearances mean a little less to you. When the Fields-Medallist professor tries teaching abstract algebra
using memes, legendary academic prizes no longer seem that esoteric.
<br /><br />
And I've felt this myself. At school in Abu Dhabi, if someone in the country--much less my high school--gets into Oxford or Stanford,
it's instantly national news. Over time, I pattern-matched these students that won international olympiads and started nonprofits in
high school as "prodigies". I put them in a bin in my head as genetically gifted, on a level I'd never reach no matter how hard I tried.
<br /><br />
And then, at Westminster, I saw them dancing at clubs and taking a dump in the morning, groggy at breakfast and drifting
asleep in lessons.
<br /><br />
Very quickly, I came to realise the secret. There are no "prodigies" and
no-one is "genetically gifted". These boys and girls were humans, as much as I.
Humans that broke into greatness through a combination of enormous ambition, unwavering discipline, and
fortunate circumstance. On my first day at Westminster, I sat down for lunch with three innucous guys; "lads" in the truest sense of the
word. Later, I learned that one was on the GB Olympic rowing team, another was an IMO medallist, and the third had 500,000 subscribers
on YouTube.
<br /><br />
In Abu Dhabi, being cross-admitted to Harvard and Trinity College, Cambridge, was a fantastical dream--one that
I wouldn't have had the audacity to remotely entertain, even when alone at night, tossing and
turning in bed. At Westminster, there's someone who does it every year (the guy in the grade
above me with the same choice is a friend of mine, now also at Harvard). I was nothing special. If you win a Rhodes Scholarship
in Kansas, you've made history. You're instantly a local celebrity, the governer comes to your house to congratulate you. At Harvard? You get a copy-and-pasted
email congratulating you--and of course, the other 6 that also won the scholarship--this year alone. I'm convinced
it is <i>this</i> realisation being forcibly thrust upon students that makes them great. Understanding this fact
means that you come to realise that there's really no reason that <i>you</i> can't be great, and that there's nothing special about those that are.
<br /><br />
And finally, members of elite institutions so often do great things because they are arrogant and entitled enough to believe they can.
This is a corollary to the reason above, but is different enough for me to need to explain it as a separate point. When you go to
Princeton or Eton, or work at McKinsey or Google, society instantly--incessantly--brands you as "elite".
I don't think most people at these institutions inherently think they are any better than anyone else,
but time and time again, people you meet will gasp in awe, mumble in jealousy, be stunned with shock, and tell you that you're now
destined for greatness--that there's only so low you can go in life now, unthinkingly and
repeatedly showering you with profligate amounts of praise. <br /><br />
At first it's flattering. Gratifying, even. But over time,
when family, friends, old class-mates, ex-girlfriends, and all of society is telling you that you are part of the
hand-picked 0.01% that will change the world, it becomes easier and easier to believe them. And since "the people who
are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do", this is a positive feedback loop--a vicious cycle. <i><strong>You don't
get that round of seed funding from Sequioa just because your startup is that good, it's also because they saw how convinced you were
that you will succeed when you pitched to them, and liked your conviction. You don't get preferentially hired by Goldman because
you're actually much smarter than the guy who went to Ohio State, but because you come across as so self-assured--bordering on
arrogant--and entitled to success that they know you'll find a way to get it.</strong></i>
<br /><br />
All three of these reasons, together, come together to put elite institutions a hair above merely "excellent" ones. I'm confident that this is as
true of the US Women's Soccer Team as it is of competitive Russian programmers and Korean e-sports whizzes. Look carefully,
and you'll spot these factors at play everywhere, acting only to perpetuate inequality by helping
one generation of winners hand-pick the next generation of winners in society. <i>So the next time that
people tell you that Cambridge or Facebook is an elite organisation because of its wealth and resources, or even the "network" it provides,
know that they are letting on only a fraction of the real story.</i>

<h3>On Parenthood and Conversation</h3>
<p class="notop">
  <i>
A lone silver molar, nestled comfortably inside an Afghani smile, glistened in the rear-view mirror of my Uber, almost as if beckoning the midnight moon to outshine it. Outside, the night sky sat still, washing the heavens with black. As we spoke, it was as if he and I were the only two people in the world.
</i>
<br /><br />
The ability to have sustained, intense, meandering conversations is, in my opinion, one of humanity’s most distinctive traits. The stones of conversation that most leave unturned stand out to me, gleaming in with potential, begging to see the light of day.
I think that there is a conversation special to every set of people—one conversation, at least, that only a given set of people can have at a given place at a given time. Despite my imperfections, many of which I am working <i>desperately </i>to address, I think one thing I <i>am </i>very good at is finding that conversation.
<br /><br />
But this gift is not my own. It is, as with most other things, merely a product of good circumstance. A result of a lottery of sorts—the “ovarian lottery”, as Warren Buffet puts it. My father has always owned this gift, this spellbinding ability to have
interesting conversations with strangers, to engage people and make them feel valued. Every interaction I witnessed him take part in was a verbal seduction, of sorts. Watching him lead a discussion, no matter who with,
was to witness the slowest of surrenders, the kind you want to relive over and over again, as if rewatching a magician’s hand, desperate to catch the moment of slight.
<br /><br />
But there is no trick here.
<br /><br />
It was with Afghani taxi drivers and Greek tablestaff, Kenyan construction workers and Canadian colleagues that he wove his conversational magic. I was a young, impressionable eight year old, bewitched by his charisma, watching him
masterfully play lexical chess, taking ritualistic small talk and seamlessly transfiguring it into meaningful, memorable conversation; conversation where the other person felt important, special, singularly valued and understood. Unwittingly, they
would reveal, as if hesitantly—but with a whisper of relief—their stories, backgrounds, experiences, excited to share a glimpse of the raw, unfettered beauty dancing silently inside their skull.
Through this, he learned what it was like growing up in a civil-war stricken Kabul with a single mother, and why an Athenian man regrets leaving his lover at the alter. Vicariously, he lived in Nairobi as the son of a famous businessman who was cast out of the house
at fourteen, and as a science-obsessed young girl in Toronto whose only ambition in life was to become a pediatric surgeon.
<br /><br />
He lived a million lives in one.
<br /><br />
I wanted little more to have that ability, to weave that black magic and enchant powerless onlookers with games of words and phrases and hypnotic syntactic trickery.
<br /><br />
I wanted little more than to be like him.
<br /><br />
And slowly, I learned. I learned to ask questions when others would be silent, to disagree and challenge when others would back down. I learned to poke and prod, and lose myself in the deep waters of the other person’s life,
imbibing their experiences as if sipping the nectar of forbidden fruit; fruit that was hidden and ugly on the surface, but bracing and delicious inside. I learned to ask weird questions and give weird answers, to listen and understand as if I was
to be tested on the details of the speaker’s life. Day in and day out, living with my father would beat these subtle habits into me until I graduated from the rank of apprentice, and started to weave spells of my own.
<br /><br />
And I didn’t realise this until today, while taking an Uber back from the airport with, well, an Afghani driver. Because of this gift, I’ve been blessed with an understanding of what it’s like being a Lebanese matriarch running a San Francisco café, and
what it’s like being a Gambian immigrant struggling to make ends meet in an extended family. Through conversation, I’ve looked the eyes of south Indian husbands as they catch sight of their arranged wives-to-be,
and smelled the terrifying scent of lead lining the roads of a war-torn Aleppo. These conversations have been hidden in Uber drives from the airport—sure—but they’ve also worn the mask of hairdressers shaving my head and waiters blowing clouds while on break,
nervous algorithmists coding furiously in the solace of libraries, and unruly breakdancers taking a rare moment to reflect on childhoods spent dancing with their grandparents.
<br /><br />
And all of these are strands of a human narrative I would’ve been powerless to play with if it weren’t for my father’s gift, and my childhood spent watching him exercise it. This is why I believe that your parents control a large part of your fate.
By that, I don't mean that their wealth defines your education and opportunities.
No, I mean instead that nepotism most wreaks havoc by perpetuating skills that can’t be learned online. If someone shy and antisocial tried to hone their ability to weave memorable conversations with virtual strangers,
it would be very hard to catch up with me simply because I have a near two-decade head start. And that comes down to who my parents were, and how they behaved as I grew up around them.
Equally, my friends wield gifts I can only dream of beholding. I know boys who walk with blind, iron-clad confidence, girls who can seduce on a dime. They bear the gifts of <i>their </i>parents, and the years they spent learning them through
the ultimate apprenticeship--the one we call “childhood”. So when you see someone command an audience with ease, delicately but assuredly toying with its attention and emotions, don't write them off as someone who was “born-great” at public speaking.
That is not the case. It was years of practise, of watching it being done right from one role model or another, or screwing up and doing it again—all inadvertently, subconsciously, informally, before they got up on that stage and mesmerised us.
<br /><br />
This is not an essay meant to discourage. Quite the opposite. It should be empowering to know that there is no protein encoded for by any gene that makes a human charismatic. Everyone learns it the hard way—some people just earlier and quicker than others. So if you can’t
command attention like Jobs or respect like Bond, it doesn’t mean you can’t be a better version of you. Much like their childhoods forced upon them thousands of hours of unwitting practise, you can put yourself through those hours too, consciously, knowing the results that await you at the end.
<br /><br />
So, go ahead. Talk to the old man sitting across you on the train, ask the cashier how her day <i>really </i>was. Push a little bit more than you’re comfortable with when your Uber driver is telling you about their background, use every opportunity to let people talk about themselves.
<br /><br />
They might surprise you.

<h3>Reflections Half-Way Through a Gap Year</h3>
<p class="notop">
  <ul>
  <strong><i>On Silicon Valley, Startups, and Software Engineering</strong></i>
  <li>Operations, partnerships, distribution channels, and other “business” buzzwords are just as important to understand as the actual theory behind your “revolutionary” tech innovation. 6 months ago, I’d dismiss anyone using these words as a braindead MBA monkey, but it turns out most companies and products have been built before, it’s just that new ones have an edge when it comes to partnerships, distribution channels, talent, or something else of the like. Practical implementation and distribution of a cool product is the bottleneck for great ideas more often than the technical innovation, which is a sad reality.</li><br />
  <li>The most money isn’t necessarily made in consumer products, even though that’s all we college students have ever really been exposed to. Everyone I know, my age, is thinking about how they’d make the next SnapChat or TikTok. The really successful founders and Valley veterans are instead thinking about the niche, unsexy enterprise problems that generate the most value for businesses.<br />
  <li>Being able to integrate your product with existing infrastructure and not screw over important people in the supply chain, at any point, is crucial. It’s very important to have respect for why the problem hasn’t been solved so far. If you can’t conjure a compelling answer to that, you haven’t looked hard enough. For example, the invention of DVR by TiVo was revolutionary, but they didn’t own the content distribution channels (cable TV) that their product would be used on, Comcast did. And so they failed, despite their breakthrough technology.</li><br />
  <li>A lot of the work involved in software engineering sounds complicated and world-changing, but it’s pretty mindless. Much is simply rebuilding or refactoring pedestrian products that already exist in some flavor or capacity, but with a small new change or addition to address some novel market need. For example, companies will invest thousands of engineering hours into copying each others’ products from scratch because no open-source equivalent exists. The work can be technically challenging, absolutely, but much of it is not creating anything fundamentally new in the universe. Front-end engineers often spend time working to make a certain animation marginally more memory-efficient or rearranging how the edges of a certain box look — quite a far cry from studying circuit architecture and red-black trees at college.</li><br />
  <li>Most brilliant people in the valley are excellent at solving problems but spend almost no time thinking about what problem they are solving, why they’re solving, the impact it’s likely to have, and how profitable it’s really likely to be. They just get giddy about solving something difficult. In math speak, I believe that our species has come to be very good at optimizing narrow objective functions without having any meaningful understanding of how these narrow functions relate to comprise a wider, global solution to our problems.</li><br />
  <li>Technology is almost never the inherent solution to a problem. It is just the vector through which the solution can be implemented cheaply at scale and in a clean, simple-to-use way. Uber’s breakthrough was with its business model, implemented through some neat software. Building the app was not a breakthrough. Being a 10x engineer doesn’t really give you any meaningful advantage in coming up with clever solutions, merely with implementing them. Being a technical co-founder is only useful insofar as it lets you prototype and test ideas, as well as know the limitations of the technology you’re using to build solutions (which is still very useful, I might add).</li><br />
  <li>The importance of projects is often under-appreciated. Most companies, research ideas, and works of art and literature and music came from great people tinkering and playing with things in their free time. The ability and desire to build web apps on a whim, write pieces of short fiction because of a dream, or investigate a new research topic over the summer because of a book you read, are vastly important. Tinkering and building should become routine and ubiquitous for our world to embed innovation into our culture.</li><br />
  <strong><i>On Living in, and Understanding How “The Real World” Works</strong></i><br />
  <li>I’ve come to appreciate the importance of legislation and individual behavior in enacting macroscopic change. As a techno-optimist who started the year believing that more money and talent would lead to endless innovation that would solve all of humanity’s problems. By talking to academics, entrepreneurs, and reading widely about various industries, I’m now pretty convinced that a lot of our biggest problems (climate, public education) are best solved by informed electorates who act the right way and elect responsible and intelligent leaders rather than brute force investment into technology.</li><br />
  <li>An ancillary point is that I’ve come to appreciate the complexity, beauty, and efficiency of the institutions of modernity, like democratic governments, international law, financial services, energy generation, waste management, and more world-changing machinery that would hum around under the hood of daily life, hitherto unnoticed. Everything from how VisaNet allows for instant electronic card payment between banks to how landfill pipes capture methane from trash, I’ve understood that there have been a lot of smart people who have experimented a lot of times and gone through a lot of pain and effort to come up with many of the tools and institutions we don’t even know exist.<br />
  I’ve come to see the understated difference between how large, bureaucratic institutions (government/finance) are ideally supposed to work and the twisted, complicated, corrupt and underhanded way in which they often do. This might seem to contradict my previous point, but I think that it’s consistent to hold the beliefs that democracies are beautiful, contrived and deliberate structures that have done a lot of good, but that they also creak and crack in places due to the inherent weakness of individual humans.</li><br />
  <li>College is only useful because of the people you meet — both peers and professors. Even vocational majors like mechanical engineering have limited utility in the real world, even if you’re working as a full-time mechanical engineer. The rat race to join prestigious clubs and groups and be atop the social ladder is almost laughable when you look at it as an outsider and realize how useless those races really are (including chasing grades).</li><br />
  <strong><i>General Musings</strong></i>
  <li>Reading widely and often is not a foolproof way to become an intellectual, it makes little sense to read blindly for the sake of reading. I don’t know why so many people focus on chasing “number of books per year” rather than deeply internalizing new concepts through whichever medium can best teach them about those.</li><br />
  <li>Learning languages has little to no professional utility, but the way it deepens and enriches relationships between you and people who speak that language gives you uniquely rich insight into the way they live and think. This could be gratifying and enriching for you on a personal level and is the only good reason to learn a new language in my opinion. As a trilingual, I do not think this is generally a good investment in time.</li><br />
  <li>Conspiracy theories and stereotypes are often grounded in some truth. I heard that some teams on Google and Twitter had doctored some search results leading up to the election to sway voters one way, and immediately dismissed it as fiction. Then I met some people who had a background in the industry who revealed that elements of it were not too far off.</li><br />
  <li>There are no deadlines in the real world, and life after college can easily lack a sense of urgency. You don’t meet people unless you go out of your way to convert casual interactions into meaningful relationships, and this is disconcerting and deeply uncomfortable at the beginning. It is easy to fall into a routine where you’re losing awareness of where you’re going in life since there are no clear deadlines or people to hold you to them when you’re in the real world.</li><br />
  <li>Great art, film, literature, and music do have an important place in society. For all the money, ideas, and opportunity gushing into Silicon Valley, people, including techies themselves, hate living here. With collapsing civil infrastructure and almost nothing to do outside of work and good ethnic food, there’s a palpable difference between San Francisco and cities like NYC, London, Paris, Tokyo. Even if you don’t go to art exhibitions or attend rock concerts, the fact that they happen all around you affects the pulse of the city in a subtle but noticeable way, and the lack thereof makes life just a little less vibrant as if people go home to take a short break before going back to work again, instead of the other way around.</li><br />
  <li>I’ve become disillusioned with top universities. Coming into the year, I would instinctively associate anyone with a brand-name school on their resume as world-class. Very quickly, I saw how most students at top schools are a product of circumstance, and only about 5% of the population, even at Harvard, is “elite” by Silicon Valley standards (in terms of intelligence and output). Similarly, most of the Valley “elite” did not attend Harvard (or Stanford or MIT and so forth). I see these credentials now as signifying moderate intelligence and good fortune and look to gauge whether people are smart by actually talking to them about ideas and looking at projects they’ve worked on.</li><br />

<h3>On Failure and Rejection</h3>

<!--
american unis are circumstancial vs completely predictable UK/India/Chinese unis
depends on whether you pass the bar for being very accomplished, sure, and it is a spectrum
where being more accomplished increases your odds. if you're IMO gold medallist or the daughter
or Xi Jinping, you WILL get in. but most people who get in fit neither category-some just got in
because they needed a particular combination of traits to round off the class: a banjo player who is also
interested in chemistry, for example. and so you see people objectively more ambitious, hard-working, accomplished,
interesting, and qualified, get rejected left and right. conversely, you see some who fall short in all those categories
get in, for one reason or another. it is NOT a meritocracy, and so you should be outcome independent.
