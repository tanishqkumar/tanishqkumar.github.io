    <h1>Thoughts</h1>
    <p class="notop">
It's in those moments when you're walking down the street, finishing up the last set of a workout, or taking a dump, brilliance
strikes. I have some pretty strong, certainly controversial, opinions. This page documents
them, and tries to justify them. The process of putting together these coherent bodies of thought forces me
to intimately grapple with the likely possibility that my contrarian thoughts are just wrong. If you're reading this
and disagree with anything I say, <a href="mailto:tanishq@careerfear.org">please tell me!</a> I love to change my mind.<br><br>

<h3>On the Financial Institution</h3>
<p class="notop">
<i>
Westminster and Harvard both have significant pull towards finance--whether that's at a bulge bracket investment bank (think Goldman Sachs/JP Morgan), quantitative hedge fund (think Two Sigma/DE Shaw), or fintech startup (think Addepar/Brex).
When all your most ambitious and accomplished peers are being sucked into an industry, you can't help but wonder what's so great about it. </i>
<br><br>
At the highest level of abstraction, the financial institution exists to allocate capital efficiently so society can be optimally productive. And, most of the time, it does exactly that. The big banks that are so often vilified by miseducated members of the public exist, in theory, simply to help organisations raise capital from people that want to invest. In my opinion, they do that very well.
So much so that the government bailed out the big banks in the wake of the 2008 crisis because the government recognized that their role in society is genuinely important. If no investment banks remained after the crisis, who would give companies--both big and small--access to public capital? Companies would go bankrupt, millions would be laid off, society would truly collapse. By taking money from taxpayers at the time, the US government funded the survival of some of the big banks, thereby stabilising the economic future of the American society. (An interesting side effect is the government essentially incentivised bad behaviour by bailing them out.)
<br><br>
The reason that so many of the arguments about the value of (investment) banking as an industry seem, at times, so political is because even though objective facts about its role exist, they are <i> so incredibly complex</i>.
Perhaps an example will help. Let's say we're discussing the question of “did new regulations after the 2008 crisis really change the banking industry?”. Many economists will do deeply researched studies, using advanced models, and come to a conclusion
 that the regulations were, in fact, effective. The problem is, <i>equally reputable economists will do studies a slightly different—but equally valid—way and come out with the <strong>opposite </strong>conclusion</i>, giving both sides facts to fuel the—now, opinion-based—argument.
<br><br>
  The ex-banker I spoke to, who inspired this piece, confessed that he left because he didn’t find the work meaningful. The main reason that so many people hate on banking as an industry is not because of bad actors (people embezzling funds or making money solely by charging excessive management fees).
  Sure, these people exist, but they are no more common than in any other industry. In fact, what many people fail to internalise is that most financial products/services are based on advanced, sound mathematics and robust legal architecture. The reason people hate banks as institutions is that they exist to help the rich get richer. This is difficult for any seasoned banker to honestly refute. And in this sense, the banks aren’t doing good for most of society (that isn't rich).
<br><br>
  The CFO of, say, Walmart, who wants to raise capital for a new service Walmart is looking to implement, or a $4B startup looking to IPO, clearly think Goldman is worth the $10M fee they’re charging for their M&A/fundraising services, or else they wouldn’t pay it. And for the investors and execs at those companies that stand to make a lot of money when stock prices rise after funds are raised, it certainly is worth the $10M. <i>So both the bank and client come </i> out ahead.  No one seems to get “screwed”.<strong> Except, of course, the naïve member of the public</strong>, who invests without knowing all the facts. It’s their money that gets channeled into the executives’/investors' pockets. But, of course, the layperson volunteered to invest their money; no-one forced them to do it. They just didn’t have an "edge" when betting on the market, and so lost their money as a consequence of being uninformed. Then complained about it.
<br><br>
  To tackle a common misconception--some thing that employees benefit when companies raise capital. This is almost never the case. When a company, say Walmart, raises money, its 2.7 million employees do NOT get a raise. Their lives are left unchanged. They are no better off. The only argument that can even be <i> attempted </i> by the aspiring
  banker is that fuelling companies by supplying them with access to capital means that they grow more effectively and provide more value for their consumers. More concretely put, if Walmart raises $2B from investors in a transaction set up by JP Morgan,
  it can kickstart that new service that will then sell to millions of Americans and add value to <i> those </i> lives. My response to this argument is: no shit, that's what the bankers are being paid for. This argument, while undeniably true,
  emphasises value that is, in my opinion, too far removed from the everyday human to be clearly meaningful work. No banker wakes up in the morning with a skip in their step thinking, "boy-oh-boy, I can't wait to help society allocate it's capital more productively", whereas many
  surgeons <i> do </i> wake up thinking "wow, I can't wait to do that open-heart-surgey--I can only imagine the impact saving the father's life will have on the family" or, in the software engineer's case, "boy, I'm excited to implement that new feature that will
  help billions of people search the internet, even if my own contribution is only a small piece."
<br><br>
  The dull reality that most bankers are cogs in a machine that is--at best, contributing tangential value to society, and at worst, actively screwing over millions--
  becomes so much more apparent as you begin to bear children of your own. At that point, you start to think more carefully about the effects your actions have on other people--people like your tender, starry-eyed children. Perhaps that's why so many people leave banking with a bad taste in their
  mouth around the ages of 40-50, right as their children hit adolescence and their futures are financially secure.

<h3>Hard Work vs Discipline</h3>
<p class="notop">
  It's 5am. You jolt awake, exasperated. Frustrated, angry, that your former self of just 7 hours ago would have the audacity
  to force your present self out of deep, peaceful sleep. You're proud that you're up, though. You don't spend your usual
  20 minutes mindlessly scrolling on Instagram. You're on a mission. Even on the way to the bathroom to brush your teeth,
  you walk with a purpose, as if steadying to run in the direction of your dreams. An hour later, you find your
  citrus Nike shirt--the one your sister told you makes you look like a traffic cone--is wet with the proof of your hard work.
<br><br>
  You get ready for school, pulling your charcoal socks up to the middle of your shin like an athlete laces up before an
  Olympic final. While others frolick playfully in the dining hall, you give up your lunchtimes to work. After school,
  you work. Only when the sun sets again at dusk do you hesitantly--as if terrified that the gods might strike you down--
  take a breather. You're exhausted. But you've prayed to mantras of "grinding" and "outworking";
  this is not when you let up. Another motivational video pushes you through yet another hour of bleary eyed study. As your city
  slips into the depths of darkness, you do too. Then you do it all over again.
<br><br>
  Welcome to the grind.
<br><br>
  This was my life for two years. In Year 11 and 12 (sophomore & junior year) of high school, I was obsessed. Obsessed with
  getting into Westminster as a way to escape the shackles of a mediocre education, obsessed with matching
  the very best in the world.
  To a weary but hopeful mid-teen, the phrase "hard work" was more than another empty truism. It was a lifestyle. I thought
  I was a demi-god, politely fabricating elaborate excuses for missing friends' parties--as if my
  paternal grandfather really <i> was </i> in town for his knee surgey--only to spend quiet Friday evenings at my desk,
  in the depths of study. I don't know what I was looking to prove. Perhaps it was a former debater trying to convince himself
  that he was more than just an articulate speaker, that he could compete academically with the very best math & science
  students on Earth. Perhaps it was
  an anxious teen at a competitive high school, refusing to "settle" when applying to college.
<br><br>
  What I <i> do </i> know is that I wasn't going about working the most effective way. Sure, I got a lot done. This way,
   I completed 2 A-levels in 5 weeks during summer. I scaled an education equity nonprofit while
  sipping undergraduate biology on the side.
<br><br>
  But now, at 18, I look back and cringe. I'm disappointed that I ever really believed that
  "hard work" was what forged greatness. That becoming great at whatever you did necessarily meant devoting every waking hour,
  feeling socially asphixiated, giving up so many things you love, pushing your body to its physical limits.
<br><br>
  How childish.
<br><br>
  Some of you may be shaking your head, curious as to where exactly that logic breaks down. We see Musk touting his 100-hour work week, athletes
  doing nothing but train all day on TV. This is what the world has always said. So, surely, "hard work", does
  in fact mould champions.
<br><br>
  Nope.
<br><br>
  I'll tell you what <i> does</i>. Productivity. One thing I've realised too late is that the romantic notion of putting in enormous amounts of time
  has little bearing on how much you accomplish. This is an empirical observation.
<br><br>
  But how can that be? The more hours you pour into something, the better you'll be. Right? Right. <i>If, and only if,</i> you hold
  intensity (how much you achieve in every hour) constant. In reality, those hours I was awake at 6am, studying for an hour and a half
  before school, I achieved almost nothing. I could barely focus. I'd stare at textbooks, blindly trying to
  grasp material like my mom holding up a gargantuan pile of clothes at a thrift shop, overwhelmed,
  clasping at clothes as they fall by the wayside. The amount of work I got done in those 90 minutes was equivalent to around 20 minutes of
  deep, focused work at my peak.
<br><br>
  And to get to that peak consistently, I needed 9+ hours of sleep (personal observation). I needed to hang out with friends.
  And so as I grew older and wiser, I turned in my obsession with "hard work" and motivational videos for something far more subtle.
  Discipline. During my gap year, I get 11 hours of sleep a night (the natural amount I sleep without setting an alarm), with no regrets.
  What I do make sure to do, however, is to have <i> habits </i> in place to make sure that, during the 13 hours I <i>am</i> awake,
  shit gets done. I split my day into three chunks, 5-2-2. 5 hours spend coding, 2 hours spend reading, and 2 horus spent breakdancing.
<br><br>
  Let me clarify. It takes me 7 hours to put in those 5 hours writing code. By 5 hours coding, I really mean 5 hours spent, butt-in-chair,
  focused while typing furiously at the keyboard. I set a timer, and stop it every time I go to the toilet. Every time I get water.
  Every time I take a 10 minute break. And so ultimately, to excise those 9 hours of productivity every day, I have to spend 11-12 hours "working".
<br><br>
  And I'm seeing progress like never before. In 1 hour of silent, uninterrupted work, I can lose myself in the deep waters of focus.
  I get more done in an hour now than in almost a whole day of maniacal "hard work". And I advise you to do the same. Like a sinner
  who comes to a place of worship seeking impunity, turn in your childish obsession with "hard work", and supplant it with a more
  mature understanding of the power of discipline and habit. The power of keeping to rituals, and hitting them realistic daily goals.
  Every. Single. Time. Hitting the 5-2-2 target 90% of the time is <i>far</i> more productive than consistently
  getting only 50% use out of 16-hour-workdays, no matter how hard Elon Musk says he's working.
<br><br>
  Don't get me wrong. When I'm working on my PhD thesis, or about to pitch for Series A for a startup, I will have to work hard AND
  be disciplined. There are moments in life where you should sacrifice your social life and health for peak intelletual performance.
  At those points, I will have to regularly execute 16-hour-days at 100% efficiency. But I cannot do that
  for years on end. Anyone who says they can is lying to you. In those 16 hours, they probably get 8-9 hours of real work done, just
  as I do.
<br><br>
  Except, of course, I do it while sleeping 11 hours a day :)

<h3>What I'm Doing During My Gap Year</h3>
<p class="notop">

I never considered taking a gap year until my father mentioned it, and that too, in passing. Listening to him explain how it could help me "see the world through a different lens"
made me want to laugh. Mulling over it, though, I did think that I learned and grew the most when left to my own devices;
when I was given the autonomy to make decisions about what <i>I thought </i>I should learn or try. And when asking myself why I wasn't taking a gap year
in the first place, the only compelling answer I could conjure up was the "it wasn't the beaten path". Not very convincing. But it always kind of
felt like gap years were for people who didn't get into college the first time--right?
<br><br>

Before I knew it, I was curled up in my bed, furiously shaking the last few drops of ink out of a dark blue ball point, biting at it's
top as I grappled with what I'd make of the year ahead, like an artist lost in thought over myriad possibilities for his
blank canvas. A good starting point was to see what others did during their gaps.<br><br>I was disappointed. <br><br>Most people
did tokenist volunteer work--the kind that feels like it's life-changing while you're doing it but 2 weeks after you get back to your
comfy home in a wealthy country, the experience is little more than a resume bullet point, leaving the very people you were helping just as
powerless as before you visited them. Alternatively, many others would they just travel and learn languages. At this point,
I was fluent in 3 languages, and didn't think learning languages, in general, was a great time investment. People do business in English
around the world, and many countries won't take you seriously because they can tell you're a foreigner no matter how well you
speak their language. To locals, it seems cute, at best, and is utterly useless, at worst.<br><br> Others take gap years to work, to make some
money, or to "take a breather". Many people who work during that year come from backgrounds where they genuinely need to contribute
to help support their families. I admire and deeply respect those people. Many others, however, don't think very critically
about which job they're doing, and end up learning very little, and indeed also earning very little. They would've been far better
off adding 1 more year of work <i> after </i> a college degree. And as for those "taking a breather", I'm sure they have their reasons,
but I didn't want my year to take away from the early intellectual momentum I'd built up in the last few years of high school. I wanted it to be my most
intense year yet. I believe around 90% of people who take a gap year would've been better off without one. But for the 10%
that make full, intentional use of the year, it changes their life. But with the most common things to
do during a gap year off the table, what else was there to consider?
<br><br>
Searchingly planning out what I'd do in the years after my gap gave me the answer. Did I want to be a surgeon, like my father?
Perhaps work on Wall Street, living a comfortable and "prestigious" life, like so many others that walked the Harvard path. Or
parrot out condescensions towards those that "sold themselves out", convincing myself that I would do something more "meaningful"?<br><br>
Daydreaming, I thought back to when I was young. As a little person, I always thought that society would hand-pick the best, the brightest,
and pit them against humanity's biggest challenges. If you were "special" enough to attend an elite school, you had greatness
stamped onto your destiny; you'd give up your life tackling climate change, curing cancer, exploring Mars, all for
the betterment of your people, right? Wrong. As I grew up,
<i>I witnessed the best and brightest flock to optimise ads for a search engine, or take clients out to ritzy hotels and expense
it under the firm's name.</i>
<br><br>
But it doesn't have to be that way. If I wanted to live in that world, I better help build it. And that meant that if I aspired to be
part of this esoteric "best and brightest", I had a duty to pit myself against the world's most pressing challenges. But what were those?
Stepping back, I thought about industries, problems, themes that would be indisputably important in our species' future. For starters,
Climate change was something we'd have to tackle sooner or later. And that required a rewiring of the world's energy infrastructure,
a multi-trillion dollar industry. So I made a note of those, as industries that piqued my interest.
<br><br>
And what about meaning? Future generations would want to find meaning in a life where all our mundane tasks, like doing taxes and
constructing buildings, were encoded away to machines. I thought back to how technology might help people derive a sense of purpose
in life. If you've ever been addicted to a video game, you know how you can wake up, start playing, and realise it's midnight before
you know it. Gaming, I convinced myself, was going to become more immersive and detailed as the technology powering game engines
advanced. Virtual, augmented reality, would change the way we interact with our world. We didn't have to
travel to France or Japan in real life, we merely had to convince our mind that we were doing so. And that was
something immersive video games could do. Another industry to watch.
<br><br>
But how do we guarantee technological progress happens at this fast rate I've assumed? How do we know future generations will be
as ambitious, conniving, hopeful as we are? We must educate them. When I could learn more self-studying over a summer than I could in two
years of high school, it was clear something was wrong. And my work in education equity with CareerFear has bound me to a core belief that the annals of history will most clearly remember not individual achievements, but generational strides: the kind that only come about when everyone is equipped to contribute.
Could technology make education more personal? More accessible? That was another set of questions I wanted answered.
<br><br>
And these are just industries I've had some exposure to. What are some enormous industries that I'd never had any exposure to?
Well, how about the industry supported by the biggest financial institutions on Earth? Governments themselves. Military and defense
budgets are <i>quite literally </i> orders of magnitude larger than most other industries. They're just more stealthy. Which kid
grows up wanted to build weapons and technology that governments rely on? But that's the very predicate on which our planet's peace
is built--mutually assured destruction. Add that industry to the list.
<br><br>
And finally, I'd always had a childhood fascination with architecture. Perhaps it was a Indian kids way of rebelling
against his parents, who were so conspicuously were nudging him towards STEM, to threaten a career in architecture.
Stunning structures like the Burj Khalifa or Golden Gate Bridge would always leave me spellbound, amazed at
these monuments as living embodyments of their architects' wills. It begged the question: what would buildings look like in the future?
More generally, what would <i> cities </i> look like in the future? Why are we
trying to make autonomous vehicles instead of more walkable cities?
How would technology change the way we interact with our urban environments,
and how did that interplay with our struggles with global warming and mobility?
<br><br>
So I had my list. I wanted to spend a sizeable portion of the year learning about these 6 industries: energy & climate, agriculture & the environment,
defense & military, education, gaming/media, and urban/transport technology. All through a lens of how software and algorithms could
transform these fields. These were fields that could conceivably change the world, but fields that I would never otherwised be exposed to.
I would have plenty of time in Boston to learn about fintech and biotech, but when would I seriously think about feeding the planet,
autonomous weapons, or machine learning as an educational tool? <strong> Never</strong>, <i>unless I took this year to do exactly that.</i>
<br><br>
Originally, I hoped to work for two months in each of these industries, as an intern. Quickly, I spotted a flaw in my reasoning. How much would I <i>really</i>
learn working at some low-level position doing some repetitive, mundane task, several layers under a boss who was the one that I'd really get
to learn from. Instead, it made more sense to learn about these the way I'd learn anything else--by reading books,
scouring the internet, and talking to smart people working in these industries. So everyday, for 3 hours, I read and make notes,
I meet engineers, entrepreneurs, academics working in these spaces from time to time, picking their brain about what they think
the future of their industry is.
<br><br>
But what about the other 21 hours a day? Let's say I slept for 8-9 of them, and spent 1-2 cooking, cleaning, and generally
adulting. I had around 10 to play with. What to do? Well, if I found an industry I was interested in, I might conceivably come across
an interesting business idea while in college. After all, the 4 years you spend in college are around brilliant, ambitious peers,
enormously intelligent and accomplished professors, and the university handing you money for your projects on a platter. What better
place to change the world? But if I was going to transform energy technology, game technology, or any other technology, I needed to
be a technologist. <br><br>High school programming wouldn't cut it. I needed to immersively
lose myself in a crucible of tech, and come out with the ability to build out any idea I had--whether that was a web app (like Facebook),
mobile app (like Uber), or more complicated software (like Microsoft's Windows). Think of how Gates and Zuckerberg had put in thousands of hours
<i>mastering</i> programming before they even set foot on the Harvard campus.
<br><br>
<i><strong>But Tanishq--you learn all that during college anyways. That's the point of a CS degree, right?</i></strong> <br><br>No. Wrong. Categorically incorrect.<br><br>
I thought so too. In fact, computer science, as colleges teach it, and software engineering--the act of building the products
we use on a daily basis--have relatively little overlap. This stunned me, and it should shock you too.
When I spoke to software engineers, they told me that their jobs involved <i>only 1 or 2 courses from college</i>,
and the rest was things they learned during internships--stuff like using programming frameworks (Django, React, etc.),
getting accustomed to programming systems (writing lots of code), and studying engineering best practices (learning on the job).
<br><br>
That sealed the deal. The bulk of my day would be spent learning software engineering. How? Maybe an intensive bootcamp? Maybe by
getting a job as a software engineer? Well, to get a job, you have to know how to do it. And bootcamps were educational institutions,
no matter how intense they claimed to be, I was sure I could do it better, faster, myself. And so I lined up some online courses,
a bunch of projects I wanted to build, and got to work. This takes up around 6 hours of my day.
<br><br>
In the end, it seems backwards. I'm taking a year out to...learn programming and read? <i><strong>Isn't that exactly what a college degree, majoring in CS, would
teach you?<br><br></i></strong><img src="/static/meme1.jpg" height="200" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><br>
 I'm convinced this is the sort of pattern-matching thinking that
leads people astray in the first place. When you dig into the details, you see that the programming I'm doing is preparation
to build useful, marketable products, not prove abstract computational theorems (a CS degree), and the reading I'm doing
is about the future of industries I may very well end up working in, not grappling with esoteric philosophical prose (the kind
you do a lot of in college). Not to say those things aren't important--they have their place, and I'll make sure to do them
when I'm in college. But before I get there I need to know how to be useful first. So I'm sorting that out.
<br><br>
And in the evenings, I breakdance.
