    <h1>Thoughts</h1>
    <p class="notop">
It's in those moments when you're walking down the street, finishing up the last set of a workout, or taking a dump, that brilliance
strikes. I have some pretty strong, certainly controversial, opinions. This page documents and justifies
 them. The process of putting together these coherent bodies of thought forces me
to intimately grapple with the likely possibility that my contrarian thoughts are just wrong. If you're reading this
and disagree with anything I say, <a href="mailto:tanishq@careerfear.org">please tell me!</a> I love to change my mind.<br><br>

<h3>On the Financial Institution</h3>
<p class="notop">
<i>
Westminster and Harvard both have significant pull towards finance--whether that's at a bulge bracket investment bank (think Goldman Sachs), quantitative hedge fund (think Two Sigma), or fintech startup (think Addepar).
When all your most ambitious and accomplished peers are being sucked into an industry like specks of dust unthinkingly marching up a vacuum's long snout, you can't help but wonder what's so great about the industry in the first place. </i>
<br><br>
At the highest level of abstraction, the financial institution exists to allocate capital efficiently so society can be optimally productive. And, most of the time, it does exactly that. The big banks--yes, the very same ones that are so often vilified by miseducated members of the public--exist simply to help organisations raise capital from people that want to invest. In my opinion, they do this very well.
So much so that the US government bailed out the big banks in the wake of the 2008 crisis because the government recognized that the economy would collapse without them. If no investment banks remained, who would give companies--both big and small--access to public capital? Companies would go bankrupt, millions would be laid off. Disaster. By taking money from taxpayers at the time, the US government funded the survival of some of the big banks,
thereby stabilising the immediate economic future of American society (but also thereby incentivising bad behaviour).
<br><br>
The reason that claims about the value of (investment) banking as an industry seem so political is because even though objective facts about the importance of the industry's role exist, they are <i> incredibly complex</i>.
Perhaps an example will help. Let's say we're debating, say, whether new regulations after the 2008 crisis removed bad actors in the banking industry. Many economists will do deeply researched studies, using advanced models, and come to a conclusion
 that the regulations were, in fact, effective. Looking carefully, we find that herein lies the problem. <i>Equally reputable economists will do studies a slightly different—-but equally valid—-way and come out with the <strong>opposite </strong>conclusion</i>, giving both sides "facts" to fuel their respective fires.
<br><br>
  The ex-banker I spoke to—-who inspired this piece—-confessed that he left because he didn’t find the work meaningful. The main reason that so many people hate on banking as an industry is not because of bad actors (people embezzling funds/overcharging management fees).
  Sure, these people exist, but they are no more common than in any other industry. In fact, what many people fail to internalise is that most financial products/services are based on complex, but very sound, mathematics and robust legal architecture--even if it, at times, seems unecessarily convoluted.
  Let me restate that for emphasis. The financial products and services people in Silicon Valley find confusing and nebulous are often very effective, well-researched, vehicles to efficiently allocate society's capital.
  The reason people hate banks (and the only justifiable one), is instead that they exist to help the rich get richer. In this sense, the banks aren’t directly doing good for the bottom 99%.
<br><br>
  The CFO of, say, Walmart, who wants to raise capital for a new service Walmart is looking to implement, or, say, a $4B startup looking to IPO, clearly think Goldman is worth the $10M fee they’re charging for their M&A/fundraising services, or else the companies wouldn’t pay it. And for the investors/execs at these big companies that stand to make a lot of money when stock prices rise after funds are raised, going with Goldman certainly is worth the $10M. <i>So both the bank and client come </i> out ahead.  No one seems to get “screwed”.<strong> Except, of course, the naïve member of the public</strong>, who invests in the company looking to raise money without knowing all the facts. It’s<i>their</i> money that gets channeled into the executives’/investors' pockets (there is, after all, only a finite of capital that exists in society). But, of course, the layperson volunteered to invest their money; no-one forced them to do it. They just didn’t have an "edge" when betting on the market, and so lost their money. Then complained about it, and scapegoated the "evil corporates". It should be noted that there exceptions, of course—-members of the public didn't necessarily make misinformed investments when it came to the 2008 housing bubble, that really was down to miscalculations and greed on behalf of the banks.
<br><br>
  And now to tackle a common misconception: some think that employees benefit when companies raise capital. This is not the case. When a company, say Walmart, raises money, its 2.7 million employees do NOT all get a raise, or more perks. Their professional lives are left unchanged. The only argument that can even be <i> attempted </i> by the aspiring
  banker is that fuelling companies by supplying them with access to capital means that they can provide more value for their customers. More concretely put, if, say, Walmart raises $2B from investors in a transaction mediated by JP Morgan,
  it can use that money to kickstart that new autonomous 1-day delivery service that will then add convenience to millions of Americans and add value to <i> those </i> lives. My response to this argument is: no shit, that's the point of raising capital in the first place. This argument, while undeniably true,
  emphasises value-added that is, in my opinion, too far removed from the everyday human to be clearly meaningful work. The work of individual analysts at JPM and the implementation of the autonomous delivery service are many steps removed from each other, and it's difficult to know if any individual banker had a meaningful role to play
  in the whole arc at all.
<br><br>
  The dull reality is that most bankers are cogs in a machine that is--at best, contributing value that is several steps removed from wider society (like the JPM-Walmart-delivery service), and at worst, actively screwing over millions (like the 2008 crisis). Perhaps
  this becomes more apparent as you begin to bear children of your own. At this point, you start to think more carefully about the effects your actions have on other people; people like your tender, starry-eyed children. Perhaps that's why so many people leave banking with a bad taste in their
  mouths around the ages of 40-50, right as their children hit adolescence and their own futures are financially secure.

<h3>Hard Work vs Discipline</h3>
<p class="notop">
  It's 5am. You jolt awake, exasperated. Frustrated, angry, that you--only 7 hours ago--would have the audacity
  to force your present self out of deep, peaceful sleep. But you're proud that you're up. You don't spend your usual
  30 minutes scrolling mindlessly on Instagram like you're in a semi-comatose state. You're on a mission. Even on the way to the bathroom to brush your teeth,
  you walk with a purpose, as if steadying yourself to begins sprinting in the direction of your dreams. An hour later, you find your
  citrus Nike tee soaked by fruits of your workout.
<br><br>
  Readying yourself for school, you pull your charcoal socks up to the middle of your shin like an athlete deep in focus, religiously lacing up before an
  Olympic final. While others frolick playfully in the dining hall, you give up your lunchtimes to work. After school,
  you lose yourself once again in the deep waters of focus. Only when the sun sets again at dusk do you hesitantly--as if glancing to your left and right before beginning to cross a busy intersection--take a breather. You're exhausted.
  But you've prayed to mantras of "grinding" and "outworking" too long;
  this is not when you let up. Another motivational video pushes you through yet another hour of bleary eyed study. As your city
  slips into the depths of darkness, you do too. Then you do it all over again.
<br><br>
  Welcome to the grind.
<br><br>
  This was my life for two years. In Year 11 and 12 (sophomore & junior year) of high school, I was obsessed. Obsessed with
  getting into Westminster as a way to escape the shackles of a mediocre education, obsessed with academically matching
  the very best in the world.
  To a weary but hopeful mid-teen, the phrase "hard work" was more than another empty truism. It was a lifestyle. I thought
  I was a demi-god, subtly fabricating excuses for missing friends' parties--as if my
  paternal grandfather really <i> was </i> in town for his knee surgey--only to spend quiet Friday evenings at my desk,
  in the depths of concentration. I don't know what I was looking to prove. Perhaps it was a former debater trying to convince himself
  that he was more than just an articulate speaker, that he could compete with the strongest math/science
  students on Earth. Perhaps it was
  an anxious teen at a competitive high school, refusing to "settle" when applying to college.
<br><br>
  What I <i> do </i> know is that I wasn't working the right way. Sure, I got a lot done. Through brute force,
   I completed 2 A-levels in 5 weeks during summer. I scaled an education equity nonprofit while
  sipping undergraduate biology on the side.
<br><br>
  But now, at 18, I look back and cringe. I'm disappointed that I ever really believed that
  "hard work" was what forged greatness. That becoming great at whatever you did necessarily meant devoting every waking hour,
  feeling socially asphixiated, giving up so many things you love, pushing your body to its physical limits.
<br><br>
  How childish.
<br><br>
  Some of you may be shaking your head, curious as to where exactly that logic breaks down. We see Musk touting his 100-hour work week, athletes
  doing nothing but train all day on TV. This is what the world has always said. So, surely, "hard work", does
  in fact mould champions.
<br><br>
  Nope.
<br><br>
  I'll tell you what <i> does</i>. Output. Getting very important things done. Productivity. Putting in enormous amounts of time
  has little bearing on how much you accomplish. This is an empirical observation.
<br><br>
  But how can that be? The more hours you pour into something, the better you'll be. Right? Right. <i>If, and only if,</i> you hold
  intensity (how much you achieve in every hour spent working) constant. In reality, those hours I was awake at 5am, working for two hours before school, I achieved almost nothing.
  I could barely focus. Bleary eyed, I'd stare blinkingly at textbooks, blindly trying to
  retain material like my mom trying desperately to hold up a mountain of clothes at a thrift shop, only to clasp helplessly
   as they fall by the wayside. The amount of work I got done in those 120 minutes was equivalent to around 30 minutes of
  deep, focused work at my peak.
<br><br>
  And to get to that peak consistently, I needed 9+ hours of sleep (personal observation). I needed to hang out with friends.
  And so as I grew older and--allegedly--wiser, I turned in my obsession with "hard work" and motivational videos for something far more nuanced.
  Discipline. During my gap year, I get 11 hours of sleep a night (the natural amount I sleep without setting an alarm), with no regrets.
  What I do make sure to do, however, is to have <i> habits </i> in place to make sure that, during the 13 hours I <i>am</i> awake,
  shit gets done. I split my day into three chunks. 4 hours spend coding, 4 hours spend reading, and 2 hours spent breakdancing.
<br><br>
  Let me clarify. It takes me 6 hours to put in those 4 hours writing code. By 4 hours coding, I really mean 4 hours spent, butt-in-chair,
  focused while typing furiously at the keyboard. I set a timer, and stop it every time I go to the toilet. Every time I get water.
  Every time I take a 10 minute break. And so ultimately, to excise those 8 hours of productivity every day, I have to spend 11-12 hours "working".
<br><br>
  And I'm seeing progress like never before. In 1 hour of silent, uninterrupted work, I can lose myself in the deep waters of focus.
  I get more done in an hour now than in almost a whole day of maniacal "hard work". And I advise you to do the same. Like a sinner
  worriedly creeping into a place of worship, seeking impunity, turn in your childish obsession with "hard work". Supplant it with a more
  mature understanding of the power of discipline and habit. The power of keeping to rituals, and hitting realistic daily goals.
  Every. Single. Day. Hitting the 4-4-2 target 90% of the time is <i>far</i> more productive than consistently
  getting only 50% use out of 16-hour-workdays, no matter how hard Elon Musk says he's working.
<br><br>
  Don't get me wrong. When I'm working on my PhD thesis, or about to pitch for Series A for a startup, I will have to work hard AND
  be disciplined. There are moments in life where you should sacrifice your social life and health for peak intelletual performance.
  At those points, I will have to regularly execute 16-hour-days at 100% efficiency. But I cannot do that
  for years on end. Anyone who says they can is lying to you. In those 16 hours, they probably get 8-9 hours of real work done, just
  as I do.
<br><br>
  Except, of course, I do it while sleeping 11 hours a day :)

<h3>What I'm Doing During My Gap Year</h3>
<p class="notop">

I opted to take a gap year only weeks before being supposed to start at Harvard. Laughing, always, listening to my father first suggest the idea, and explain how it could
help me "see the world through a different lens" made me cringe. Mulling over it, though, I did learn and grow the most when left to my own devices;
when I was given the autonomy to make decisions about what <i>I thought </i>I should learn or try, and how I should learn it. And when asking myself why I wasn't taking a gap year
in the first place, the only compelling answer I could conjure up was the "it wasn't the beaten path". Not very convincing.
<br><br>
Before I knew it, I was curled up in my bed like a hot dog in a big ol' bun, furiously shaking the last few drops of ink out of a dark blue ball point, biting at it's
top as I grappled with what I'd make of the year ahead. I felt like an artist lost in thought, paralysed the myriad stories he might tell
through the medium of his starchy white canvas. A good starting point was to see what others did during their gap years.
<br><br>I was disappointed.
<br><br>
Most people did tokenist volunteer work--the kind that feels like it's life-changing while you're doing it but 2 weeks after you get back to your
comfy home in a developed country, is little more than a resume bullet point, leaving the very people you were "helping" just as
powerless as before you visited them. Volunteering? Cross that one off the list. Others would travel, experience culture, and learn languages. At this point,
I was fluent in 3 languages, had grown up living on almost every continent on Earth. I didn't think learning languages, in general,
was a great time investment. People do business in English around the world, and locals in many countries won't take you seriously
because they can tell you're a foreigner no matter how well you speak their language. To them, it seems cute, at best, and is utterly useless, at worst.
<br><br>
Others take gap years to work, to make some money, or to "take a breather". Many people who work during their gap years come from backgrounds where they
genuinely need to contribute to help support their families and pay for college. I admire and deeply respect those people.
Many others, however, don't think very critically about which job they're doing, and end up learning very little, as well as earning very little.
They would've been far better off adding 1 more year of work <i> after </i> a college degree. And as for those "taking a breather", I'm sure they have their reasons,
but I didn't want my year to take away from the early intellectual momentum I'd built up in the last few years of high school.
I wanted it to be my most intense year yet. I concluded that around 90% of people who take a gap year would've been better off without one.
But for the 10% that make full, deliberate use of every day of that year, and the flexibility that comes with it? It changes their life. With the most common things to
do during a gap year off the table, <i>what would I actually do, though</i>?
<br><br>
Searchingly reflectng on the years after college gave me my answer. Did I want to be a surgeon, like my father?
Perhaps work on Wall Street, living a comfortable and "prestigious" life, like so many others that walked the Harvard path. Or
parrot out condescensions towards those that "sold themselves out", convincing myself that I would do something more "meaningful"?
<br><br>
Daydreaming, I thought back to when I was young. As a little person, I always thought that society would hand-pick the best, the brightest,
and pit them against humanity's biggest challenges. If you were "special" enough to attend an elite school, you had greatness
stamped onto your destiny; you'd give up your life tackling climate change, curing cancer, exploring Mars, all for
the betterment of your species, right? Wrong. As I grew up,
<i>I witnessed the best and brightest flock to optimise ads for a search engine, or spend 80 hours a week mindlessly filling in Excel
  spreadsheets for their bulge-bracket employer.</i>
<br><br>
But it didn't have to be that way. If I wanted to live in that world, I better help build it. And that meant that if I aspired to be
part of this esoteric "best and brightest", I had a duty to put my money where my mouth was, and pit
myself against the world's most pressing challenges.<br><br>
But what were they?
<br><br>
Stepping back, I meandered through industries, problems, themes that would be indisputably important in our species' future. For starters,
climate change was a planet-scale problem we'd have to tackle sooner or later. That was for sure. And solving that required a
rewiring of the world's energy infrastructure, a multi-trillion dollar industry. I made a note of those, as industries that piqued my interest.
<br><br>
And what about meaning? Future generations would want to find meaning in a life where all our mundane tasks, like doing taxes and
constructing buildings, were encoded away to machines. I thought back to how technology might help people derive a sense of purpose
in life. If you've ever been addicted to a video game, you know how you can wake up, start playing, and realise it's midnight before
you know it. Gaming, I convinced myself, was going to become more immersive and detailed as the technology powering game engines
advanced. Virtual, augmented reality, may change the way we interact with our world. We didn't have to
travel to France or Japan in real life, we merely had to convince our mind that we were doing so. And that was
something immersive video games could do. Another industry to watch.
<br><br>
But how do we guarantee technological progress happens at this fast rate I've assumed? How do we know future generations will be
as ambitious, conniving, hopeful as we are? We must educate them. When I could learn more self-studying over a summer than I could in two
years at the most academically elite high school in the world, it was clear something was wrong. And my work in education equity with CareerFear has bound me to a core belief that the annals of history will most clearly remember not individual achievements, but generational strides: the kind that only come about when everyone is equipped to contribute.
Could technology make education more personal? More accessible? At scale? That was another set of questions I wanted answered. Add edtech to the list.
<br><br>
And these are just industries I've had some exposure to. What are some enormous industries that I'd never had any exposure to?
Well, how about the industry supported by the biggest financial institutions on Earth? Governments themselves. Military and defense
budgets are <i>quite literally </i> orders of magnitude larger than most other industries. They're just more stealthy. Which kid
grows up wanted to build weapons and technology that governments rely on? But that's the very predicate on which our planet's peace
is built--mutually assured destruction. Add that to the list.
<br><br>
And finally, I'd always had a childhood fascination with architecture. Perhaps it was my way of rebelling
against my parents, who so conspicuously were nudging me towards careers in STEM, to half-threaten them with a career in architecture.
Stunning structures like the Burj Khalifa or Golden Gate Bridge would always leave me spellbound. It begged the question:
what would buildings look like in the future? More generally, what would <i> cities </i> look like in the future? Why are we
trying to make autonomous vehicles instead of more walkable cities? How would technology change the way we interact with our urban environments,
and how did that interplay with global warming and mobility?
<br><br>
So I had my list. I wanted to spend a sizeable portion of the year learning about these 6 industries: energy/climate, agriculture/environment,
defense/military, education, gaming/media, and urban/transport technology. All studied through a lens of how software and algorithms could
transform these fields. The goal was the find problems I could spend my college education--or, indeed, a lifetime--solving. These were fields
that could conceivably change the world--and be profitable--but fields that I would never otherwised be exposed to.
I would have plenty of time in Boston to learn about fintech and biotech, but when would I seriously think about feeding the planet,
autonomous weapons, or machine learning as an educational tool? <strong> Never</strong>, <i>unless I took this year to do exactly that.</i>
<br><br>
Originally, I hoped to work for two months in each of these industries, as an intern. Quickly, I spotted a flaw in my reasoning. How much would I <i>really</i>
learn about energy working as a software engineer at an energy-tech company? Talking to employees convinced me that the answer was very little.
For example--building a front-end dashboard to display key metrics is fundamentally the same task, no matter if it's a dashboard for an energy company to look at how their oil drills are doing,
or a biotech company to understand how their drugs are working. Instead, it made more sense to learn about these industries the way I'd learn anything else
--by carefully reading books, scouring the internet, and talking to smart people working in these industries. So everyday, for 4 hours, I read and make notes,
I meet engineers, entrepreneurs, academics working in these spaces from time to time, picking their brain about what they think
the future of their industry is. Nothing has been as rewarding as reading <i> with a purpose. </i>
<br><br>
But what about the other 20 hours a day? Let's say I sleep for 9 of them, and spend 1-2 cooking, cleaning, and generally
adulting. I have around 9 more to play with. What to do? Well, if I found an industry I was interested in, I might conceivably come across
an interesting business idea while in college. After all, the 4 years you spend in college are around brilliant, ambitious peers,
enormously intelligent and accomplished professors, and the university handing you money for your projects on a platter. What better
place to change the world? But if I'm going to transform energy technology, game technology, or, indeed, any other technology, I need to
be a technologist. <br><br>Sadly, high school programming won't cut it. I need to immersively
lose myself in a crucible of tech, and come out with the ability to build out the prototype for any idea I had--whether that was a web app (like Facebook),
mobile app (like Uber), or more complicated software (like Microsoft's Windows). Think of how Gates and Zuckerberg had put in thousands of hours
<i>mastering</i> programming before they even set foot on the Harvard campus.
<br><br>
<i><strong>But Tanishq--you learn all that during college anyways. That's the point of a CS degree, right?</i></strong>
<br><br>No. Wrong. Categorically incorrect.<br><br>
I thought so too. In fact, computer science, as colleges teach it, and software engineering--the act of building the products
we use on a daily basis--have relatively little overlap. This stunned me, and it should shock you too, since most students decide to study
CS not because they want to learn about the central tenets of computational complexity, but because they want to be employed as software engineers afterwards.
When I spoke to software engineers, they told me that their jobs involved <i>only 1 or 2 courses from college</i>,
and the rest was things they learned during internships--stuff like using programming frameworks (Django, React, etc.),
getting accustomed to designing systems (writing lots of code), and studying engineering best practices (learning on the job).
<br><br>
That sealed the deal. The bulk of my day would be spent learning software engineering. How? Maybe an intensive bootcamp? Maybe by
getting a job as a software engineer? Well, to get a job, you have to know how to do it. And bootcamps were educational institutions,
no matter how intense they claimed to be, I was sure I could do it better, faster, myself. And so I lined up some online courses,
a bunch of projects I wanted to build, and got to work. This takes up around 6 hours of my day.
<br><br>
At first glance, it really does seem backwards. I'm taking a year out to...learn programming and read? <i><strong>Isn't that exactly what a college degree,
  majoring in CS, would teach you?<br><br></i></strong><img src="/static/meme1.jpg" height="200" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><br>
 I'm convinced this is the sort of pattern-matching thinking that
leads people astray in the first place. When you dig into the details, you see that the programming I'm doing is preparation
to build useful, marketable products, not prove abstract computational theorems (a CS degree). The reading I'm doing
is about the nitty-gritty details of industries I may very well end up working in, not grappling with esoteric literature (the kind
you do a lot of in college). Let me be explicit--I am not saying these things aren't important. In a world increasingly
using technology as a crutch, understanding the central philosophies and concepts of human thought is more important now than ever before. I will make sure to do these things
when I'm in college. But before I get there I need to know how to be useful first. So I'm taking a year to sort that out.
<br><br>
And in the evenings, I breakdance.
