        I'm an undergrad at Harvard studying math. I grew up 8 cities, London and Abu Dhabi chief amongst them. 
        
        <!-- I'm a first year CS PhD student at Stanford, working on deep learning. I studied math and statistics at Harvard as an undergrad, 
        and grew up mostly in Abu Dhabi and London before that. Nowadays, I split my time between Palo Alto and Bombay.  -->



        <!-- I'm a first-year computer science PhD student at MIT studying machine learning. I recently graduated 
        from Harvard with an AB in mathematics. When not at school in Cambridge, I spend most of my time in London and Bombay. Outside of work, 
        I enjoy stand-up comedy and architecture.  -->

      <h3>Past</h3>
      <p class="notop">I have been to school with sons of Guatemalan immigrants and Emirati oyster farmers, with the daughters of Indian
        cobblers and British royalty. I grew up moving from Kentucky to New York to Ohio, then to Delhi, Abu Dhabi, London, San Francisco, 
        and now, Boston. I speak Hindi and French. 
      </p>

      <p class="notop">In high school, I 
        took A-levels in Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. After a gap year in the Bay Area working as a software engineer, 
        I am now finishing math and CS degrees at college. 
      </p>

      <h3>Present</h3>
      <p class="notop">This spring, I'm exploring several research ideas in machine learning. 

      
      <h3>Future</h3>
      <p class="notop">Though I came into college intent on a career in software, 
        I plan to go to graduate school. 
        I'm curious what the right level of abstraction to study neural networks is: theorems, infinite width/depth limits, upper bounds, 
        first order approximations, relations to neuroscience, parameter dynamics, 
        pure scientific empirics without theorizing, mechanistic interpretability, or some other approach. I'm fascinated by 
        universality of learned representations, broadly defined.
