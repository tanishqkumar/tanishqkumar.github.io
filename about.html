      <p>
        I'm a sophomore at Harvard studying math. I grew up in 8 cities, London and Abu Dhabi chief amongst them. 
      </p>

Currently Reading</b>: <i> Wooster Series (Wodehouse), These Truths, Lonesome Dove, Capitalism and Freedom, The Ascent of Money.</i></p>


      <h3>Past</h3>
      <p class="notop">I have been to school with sons of Guatemalan immigrants and Emirati oyster farmers, with the daughters of Indian
        cobblers and British royalty. Growing up, I moved from Kentucky to New York to Ohio,
        then to Delhi, Abu Dhabi, London, San Francisco, and soon, to Boston.
        I speak passable Hindi and French, and am trying to pick up Mandarin. 
      </p>

      <p class="notop">I spent the first two years of high school at Cranleigh, Abu Dhabi, and the second two at Westminster School, London.
        I took A-levels in Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. I spent a gap year in the Bay Area working as a software engineer, 
        and am now studying some combination of math, statistics, economics and computer science at college. 
      </p>

      <h3>Present</h3>
      <p class="notop">I'm currently occupied mostly with schoolwork, but am using any free time to explore Boston and Cambridge on foot, including 
        spending copious hours patronising various libraries and cafes in the area. I'm also doing some economics research as a part-time 
        RA to decide whether academic economics is for me, or not. 
        On the side, I'm trying to learn more about modern American and ancient Chinese history, so please 
         <a href="mailto:tkumar@college.harvard.edu">drop me a note</a> if you have a recommendation.
      </p>

      <h3>Future</h3>
      <p class="notop">Though I came into college intent on a PhD in computer science followed 
      by a career in technology, I am currently pretty enamored with economics and statistics, and 
      am considering a career in the academy. I'd like to spend a few years in each of Shanghai, Paris, São Paulo and Sydney no matter how the next few decades play out.
      </p>


      <!-- <h3>Hobbies</h3>
      <p class="notop">
        When I'm not working, I'm breakdancing or playing golf.
        I'm currently working on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Lf9CoTh_Kk">windmill</a>. Then, I want to learn <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14WfVM98qGA?t=226">swipes</a>, <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ovtfld_ZyCs?t=165">90s</a>, <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehzSu7FzSCk&t=5">turtle spins</a>, and <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RQcjrUbnIU?t=42">handhops</a>.
        I'm a scratch golfer, as living in Abu Dhabi gave me
        plenty of sunshine in which to practise. California, where I spent much of my gap year, 
        was also an ideal place to do both things.
