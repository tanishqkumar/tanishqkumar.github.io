      <p>
        I'm a sophomore at Harvard studying math. I grew up in 8 cities, London and Abu Dhabi chief amongst them. 
      </p>

Currently Reading</b>: <i> Lives of the Laureates; Real Mathematical Analysis; The Past, Present, and Future of Statistical Science; 
  Capital in the Twenty-First Century.</i></p>


      <h3>Past</h3>
      <p class="notop">I have been to school with sons of Guatemalan immigrants and Emirati oyster farmers, with the daughters of Indian
        cobblers and British royalty. Growing up, I moved from Kentucky to New York to Ohio,
        then to Delhi, Abu Dhabi, London, San Francisco, and now, Boston.
        I speak passable Hindi and French, and am trying to pick up Mandarin. 
      </p>

      <p class="notop">I spent the first two years of high school at Cranleigh, Abu Dhabi, and the second two at Westminster School, London.
        I took A-levels in Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. I spent a gap year in the Bay Area working as a software engineer, 
        and am now studying some combination of math, statistics, economics and computer science at college. 
      </p>

      <h3>Present</h3>
      <p class="notop">I'm currently at home in Abu Dhabi for winter break, spending most of my time 
        RAing a research project in developmental economics 
        studying traffic routing and spatial equilibria in developing cities like Rio 
        de Janeiro. Otherwise, I'm trying to soak up some much needed sunshine by way of kayak and wakeboard. 

      </p>

      <h3>Future</h3>
      <p class="notop">Though I came into college intent on a career in technology, 
        I am currently contemplating a PhD in statistics. Whether this eventually leads to a career in the academy or at an industrial research lab like OpenAI is an open question in my mind. 
        I'd like to spend a few years living in each of Shanghai, Lagos, São Paulo, and Sydney no matter how the next few decades play out.
      </p>


      <!-- <h3>Hobbies</h3>
      <p class="notop">
        When I'm not working, I'm breakdancing or playing golf.
        I'm currently working on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Lf9CoTh_Kk">windmill</a>. Then, I want to learn <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14WfVM98qGA?t=226">swipes</a>, <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ovtfld_ZyCs?t=165">90s</a>, <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehzSu7FzSCk&t=5">turtle spins</a>, and <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RQcjrUbnIU?t=42">handhops</a>.
        I'm a scratch golfer, as living in Abu Dhabi gave me
        plenty of sunshine in which to practise. California, where I spent much of my gap year, 
        was also an ideal place to do both things.
