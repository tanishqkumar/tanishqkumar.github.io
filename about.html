  <p>I'm a 19 year old on a gap year in San Francisco, working on <a href="https://github.com/tanishqkumar">software projects.</a> This August, I'll start studying physics and computer science at Harvard College.

      <h3>Culture & Childhood</h3>
      <p class="notop">I have been to school with sons of Guatemalan immigrants and Emirati oyster farmers, with the daughters of Indian
        cobblers and British royalty. Through a childhood spent relocating—not by choice—from Kentucky to New York to Ohio,
        then New Delhi to Abu Dhabi, then London and now San Francisco, my identity has been molded by communities
        where diversity and difference are seen as opportunities, not threats. Ethnically, I'm Indian. On paper, I'm an American. Culturally, though, the phrase "global citizen"
        has become far more to me than a throwaway platitude.
      </p>

      <h3>Academic Background</h3>
      <p class="notop">I spent the first two years of high school at Cranleigh, Abu Dhabi, and the second two at Westminster School, London.
        I took A-levels in Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. During my tenure in London, I spoke in Westminster Abbey and went clubbing in Shoreditch,
        debated with Nobel Laureates and drank more than I'd like to admit. People often ask me where I call home. The answer is London. I loved the UK
        enough to have considered taking up my offer to study physics at the University of Cambridge, before deciding to spend those years
        stateside instead. I'm forever grateful to Westminster for leaving me with a strong interest in the mathematical sciences, and a
        unapolagetically contrarian way of thinking.
      </p>

      <h3>Future Goals</h3>
      <p class="notop">In my undergraduate years, I hope to work on projects tackling problems in fields as
        diverse as waste management, financial access and game engines,
        then going to graduate school to study theoretical computer science. Any predictions beyond the next
        10 years are likely to be near-fictional, and so I won't venture any guesses for where I'll be at age 30,
        but that's the plan for now.
      </p>

      <h3>Hobbies</h3>
      <p class="notop">
        When I'm not working or reading, I'm breakdancing or playing golf.
        I'm currently working on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Lf9CoTh_Kk">windmill</a>. Then, I want to learn <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14WfVM98qGA?t=226">swipes</a>, <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ovtfld_ZyCs?t=165">90s</a>, <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehzSu7FzSCk&t=5">turtle spins</a>, and <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RQcjrUbnIU?t=42">handhops</a>.
        I'm also a scratch golfer, as living in Abu Dhabi gave
        plenty of sunshine in which to practise. I'm sitting at 12% body fat & 67kg bodyweight as of January 2020, hoping to be at 10% and 70kg
        by the time I start at Harvard this fall.
