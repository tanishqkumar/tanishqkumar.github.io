  <p>I'm a 19 year old on a gap year in San Francisco, working on <a href="https://github.com/tanishqkumar">software projects.</a> This fall, I'll start studying physics and computer science at Harvard College.

      <h3>Culture & Childhood</h3>
      <p class="notop">I have been to school with sons of Guatemalan immigrants and Emirati oyster farmers, with the daughters of Indian
        cobblers and British royalty. Growing up, I moved from Kentucky to New York to Ohio,
        then to Delhi, Abu Dhabi, London, San Francisco, and soon, to Boston. I've become accustomed to packing up my bags and starting afresh every year or two.
        Fluent in French and Hindi, the phrase "global citizen" has become far more to me than a throwaway platitude.
      </p>

      <h3>Schooling</h3>
      <p class="notop">I spent the first two years of high school at Cranleigh, Abu Dhabi, and the second two at Westminster School, London.
        I took A-levels in Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. During my tenure in London, I gave sermons in Westminster Abbey
        and went clubbing in Shoreditch, spoke with Nobel Laureates and pushed golf trolleys through wet courses. I loved the UK--
        almost enough to take up an offer to study physics at Trinity College, Cambridge, before deciding to spend those years
        stateside instead. If you pushed me to call somewhere home, I'd probably say London.
      </p>

      <h3>Future Goals</h3>
      <p class="notop">As an undergrad, I plan on studying physics and computer science, and spend most of my free time working on software projects
        tackling problems in fields as diverse as waste management, financial access and game engines, then going to graduate school for a PhD in
        computer science. I'll then turn to starting deeply technical companies (like <a href="www.improbable.io">Improbable </a>and <a href = "ayasdi.com">Ayasdi</a>),
        hopefully spending a few years living and working in Shanghai, Paris, São Paulo and Sydney in the process.
      </p>

      <h3>Hobbies</h3>
      <p class="notop">
        When I'm not programming or reading non-fiction, I'm breakdancing or playing golf.
        I'm currently working on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Lf9CoTh_Kk">windmill</a>. Then, I want to learn <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14WfVM98qGA?t=226">swipes</a>, <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ovtfld_ZyCs?t=165">90s</a>, <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehzSu7FzSCk&t=5">turtle spins</a>, and <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RQcjrUbnIU?t=42">handhops</a>.
        I'm a scratch golfer, as living in Abu Dhabi gave
        plenty of sunshine in which to practise. I'm eagerly hoping to spend a few months at the end of this year
        learning to ballroom dance (the tango, salsa, waltz) as well as to sail.
