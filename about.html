      <p>
        I'm a junior at Harvard studying math. I grew up in 8 cities, London and Abu Dhabi chief amongst them. 
      </p>

<i>Currently Thinking About</i></b>: congestion games, selfish routing, algorithmic game theory.</p>

      <h3>Past</h3>
      <p class="notop">I have been to school with sons of Guatemalan immigrants and Emirati oyster farmers, with the daughters of Indian
        cobblers and British royalty. Growing up, I moved from Kentucky to New York to Ohio,
        then to Delhi, Abu Dhabi, London, San Francisco, and now, Boston.
        I speak passable Hindi and French, and am trying to pick up Mandarin. 
      </p>

      <p class="notop">I spent the first two years of high school at Cranleigh, Abu Dhabi, and the second two at Westminster School, London.
        I took A-levels in Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. I spent a gap year in the Bay Area working as a software engineer, 
        and am now studying some combination of math, statistics, and computer science at college. 
      </p>

      <h3>Present</h3>
      <p class="notop">This fall semester, I am centering my studies broadly around the themes 
        of probability, dimensionality, and efficient inference, all of which will be important for 
        a neuroscience research project on olfactory computation I'll embark on towards the end of the semester. 
        Separately, I hope to take more weekend trips to explore the United States, and use a class studying 
        historical essayists as inspiration to rework some of my older writings.

      <h3>Future</h3>
      <p class="notop">Though I came into college intent on a career in software, 
        I am currently contemplating studying theoretical neuroscience in graduate school. 
        Pure machine learning seems to care too much about improving image classification performance, 
        and more traditional neuroscience is more interested in pinpointing molecular pathways for disease 
        than in understanding how brains act as Turing machines. I'd like to spend a
         few years living in each of Shanghai, Lagos, São Paulo, 
        and Sydney no matter how the next few decades play out.
      </p>


      <!-- <h3>Hobbies</h3>
      <p class="notop">
        When I'm not working, I'm breakdancing or playing golf.
        I'm currently working on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Lf9CoTh_Kk">windmill</a>. Then, I want to learn <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14WfVM98qGA?t=226">swipes</a>, <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ovtfld_ZyCs?t=165">90s</a>, <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehzSu7FzSCk&t=5">turtle spins</a>, and <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RQcjrUbnIU?t=42">handhops</a>.
        I'm a scratch golfer, as living in Abu Dhabi gave me
        plenty of sunshine in which to practise. California, where I spent much of my gap year, 
        was also an ideal place to do both things.
