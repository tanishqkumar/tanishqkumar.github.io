<p>I'm an 18 year old on a gap year in San Francisco, working on <a href="https://github.com/tanishqkumar">software projects </a>while running <a href="careerfear.org">an education equity nonprofit.</a>
  Next year, I start at Harvard.

<h3>Cultural Background</h3>
<p class="notop">I have been to school with sons of Guatemalan immigrants and Emirati oyster farmers, with the daughters of Indian
  cobblers and British royalty. Through a childhood spent relocating—not by choice—from Kentucky to New York to Ohio,
  then New Delhi to Abu Dhabi, then London and now San Francisco, my identity has been molded by communities
  where diversity and difference are seen as opportunities, not threats. Ethnically, I'm Indian. Culturally, though, the phrase "global citizen"
  has become far more to me than a throwaway platitude.
