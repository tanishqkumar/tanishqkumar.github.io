        I work on deep learning and recently graduated from Harvard College, where I studied math. 
        I grew up 8 cities, London and Abu Dhabi chief amongst them. 
        <br><br>

        My youth was spent in transit. I was lucky to pass childhood years watching skyscrapers
        emerge from sand dunes in Abu Dhabi, shuffling to and fro between
         cafes and cathedrals while at boarding school in London,
        and learning to think clearly as an undergrad in
        Cambridge, Massachusetts.
        

        <!-- I have been to school with sons of Guatemalan immigrants and Emirati oyster farmers, with the daughters of Indian
        cobblers and British royalty. I grew up moving from Kentucky to New York to Ohio, then to Delhi, Abu Dhabi, London, San Francisco, 
        and now, Boston.  -->

        I am fascinated by scaling and universality, broadly defined.
        My research spans language models, scaling laws, theory, and more besides. 
        Outside of research, 
        I'm particularly interested in the Indian industrialization story, and the role that AI will play in its next chapter. 
        
        <!-- I think frontier 
        deep learning research and capabilities will advance faster than most think, but also that 
        the time from that to widespread economic and social impact will be much longer  -->

        CS PhD programs this fall.  -->
