      <p>
        I'm a freshman at Harvard studying math. I grew up in 8 cities, London and Abu Dhabi chief amongst them,
and speak French and Hindi.  
      </p>

      <h3>Culture & Childhood</h3>
      <p class="notop">I have been to school with sons of Guatemalan immigrants and Emirati oyster farmers, with the daughters of Indian
        cobblers and British royalty. Growing up, I moved from Kentucky to New York to Ohio,
        then to Delhi, Abu Dhabi, London, San Francisco, and soon, to Boston.
        I speak Hindi and French, and trying to pick up Mandarin. 
      </p>

      <h3>Schooling & Academia </h3>
      <p class="notop">I spent the first two years of high school at Cranleigh, Abu Dhabi, and the second two at Westminster School, London.
        I took A-levels in Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology, and loved the UK enough to
        consider taking up an offer to study physics at Cambridge before opting to come stateside instead. 
      </p>

      <h3>Future Goals</h3>
      <p class="notop">As an undergrad, I want to go deep into complexity theory and algorithms, and spend most of 
        my free time working on software projects in urban planning and game development. After a PhD in
        computer science, I hope to start deeply technical companies (like <a href="https://www.improbable.io">Improbable </a>and <a href = "https://www.ayasdi.com">Ayasdi</a>),
        spending a few years in each of Shanghai, Paris, São Paulo and Sydney in the process.
      </p>

      <h3>Hobbies</h3>
      <p class="notop">
        When I'm not working, I'm breakdancing or playing golf.
        I'm currently working on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Lf9CoTh_Kk">windmill</a>. Then, I want to learn <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14WfVM98qGA?t=226">swipes</a>, <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ovtfld_ZyCs?t=165">90s</a>, <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehzSu7FzSCk&t=5">turtle spins</a>, and <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RQcjrUbnIU?t=42">handhops</a>.
        I'm a scratch golfer, as living in Abu Dhabi gave
        plenty of sunshine in which to practise. California, where I spent much of my gap year, 
        was an ideal place to do both things.
