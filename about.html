<p>I'm an 18 year old on a gap year in San Francisco, working on <a href="https://github.com/tanishqkumar">software projects </a>while running <a href="careerfear.org">an education equity nonprofit.</a>

<h3>Cultural Background</h3>
<p class="notop">I have been to school with sons of Guatemalan immigrants and Emirati oyster farmers, with the daughters of Indian
  cobblers and British royalty. Through a childhood spent relocating—not by choice—from Kentucky to New York to Ohio,
  then New Delhi to Abu Dhabi, then London and now San Francisco, my identity has been molded by communities
  where diversity and difference are seen as opportunities, not threats. Ethnically, I'm Indian. Officially, I'm an American. Culturally, though, the phrase "global citizen"
  has become far more to me than a throwaway platitude.
</p>

<h3>Academic and Educational Background</h3>
<p class="notop">I spent the first two years of high school at Cranleigh, Abu Dhabi, and the second two at Westminster School, London.
  I took A-levels in Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. During my tenure in London, I spoke in Westminster Abbey and went clubbing in Shoreditch,
  debated with Nobel Laureates and drank more than I'd like to admit. People often ask me where I call home. The answer is London. I loved the UK
  enough to have considered taking up my offer to study physics at the University of Cambridge, before deciding to spend those years
  stateside instead. I'm forever grateful to Westminster for leaving me with a strong interest in the mathematical sciences, and a
  unapolagetically contrarian way of thinking.
</p>

<h3>CareerFear</h3>
<p class="notop">People don't spend enough time thinking critically about what they want to do with their lives. And for many, this
  is because they don't have the resources to be able to. <a href="careerfear.org">CareerFear</a> is a nonprofit that works with underfunded high schools
  and students from modest backgrounds, offering high-quality careers and higher education counselling. I started it as a
  bedroom experiment in Abu Dhabi in 2015, and it has since grown into a team of 126 volunteers in 14 countries that have worked
  directly with 7,000+ students, impacted 45,000+ more. I'm grateful to have received widespread recognition from this work, from being featured
  on <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/videos/us/2019/05/14/champions-for-change-chris-cuomo-mattie-stepanek-vpx.cnn/video/playlists/life-questions-champs-change/">CNN</a> and <a href="https://gulfnews.com/uae/career-site-for-teens-in-uae-launched-1.2057273">Gulf News,</a>
  <a href="https://careerfear.org/press/">amongst others</a>, to winning <a href="https://careerfear.org/press/">international awards for entrepreneurship.</a>
</p>

<h3>Future Goals</h3>
<p class="notop">Given my work in enabling careers counselling, it would be hypocritical of me not to think deeply about what
  I want to do with my life. Partly out of fear of settling for finance or consulting, and partly due to
  some misguided sense of duty, I'm thinking of doing a PhD in Physics or Computer Science after undergrad.
  Then maybe working at a startup investigating climate engineering, virtual reality, proof-writing software, bioinformatics,
  or smart cities. That list of topics I think are most likely to impact humanity in the future is
  very likely to change, and my career path with it, I'm sure.
</p>

<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<p class="notop">
Everyone needs a way to let off steam. When I'm not working or reading, I'm either breakdancing, playing golf, or weight training.
</p>

<h3>Breaking</h3>
<p class="notop">
  The breaking community is comprised largely of minorities and inner-city youth,
   many of whom share life experiences very different to my own.
   Right now, I'm perfecting my <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Lf9CoTh_Kk">windmill</a>
   at the moment as my first power move. Then, I want to learn<a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14WfVM98qGA?t=226"> swipes</a>, <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ovtfld_ZyCs?t=165">90s</a>
   , <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehzSu7FzSCk&t=5">turtle spins</a>, and <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RQcjrUbnIU?t=42">handhops</a>.
   Having people lose their minds when you start breakdancing at a club/party is always funny to watch. As far as
   golf is concerned, I peaked around the ages of 15-16, when I played off a 0.3 (scratch) handicap.
   I haven't picked up my clubs in almost a year, so would probably shoot around 80 if dropped on a golf course at this very
    moment. That said, I'm definitely looking to get back into peak golf shape during my gap year. And weight training
    has fallen to 1-2x a week in the wake of an intense breaking schedule. I used to do lots of calisthenics
     but then switched to weights to optimise for hypertrophy
    (muscle growth). Since then, I've been mainly focusing on compound lifts via the push/pull/legs split, but more recently have been
     experimenting with 5x5 also. I'm sitting at 12% body fat as of October 2019, and around 65kg bodyweight (145lbs for my American friends).
