      <p>
        I'm a freshman at Harvard studying math. I grew up in 8 cities, London and Abu Dhabi chief amongst them. 
      </p>

Currently Reading</b>: <i> Skin In The Game, The Ascent of Money.</i></p>


      <h3>Past</h3>
      <p class="notop">I have been to school with sons of Guatemalan immigrants and Emirati oyster farmers, with the daughters of Indian
        cobblers and British royalty. Growing up, I moved from Kentucky to New York to Ohio,
        then to Delhi, Abu Dhabi, London, San Francisco, and soon, to Boston.
        I speak passable Hindi and French, and am trying to pick up Mandarin. 
      </p>

      <p class="notop">I spent the first two years of high school at Cranleigh, Abu Dhabi, and the second two at Westminster School, London.
        I took A-levels in Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. I spent a gap year in the Bay Area working as a software engineer, 
        and am now studying some combination of math, statistics, economics and computer science at college. 
      </p>

      <h3>Present</h3>
      <p class="notop">I'm currently building some autonomous video game agents,
        trading bots, an online text editor that recommends books/blogs based on your writing,
        and trying to understand what good research in <a href="https://arxiv.org/list/stat.TH/new">statistics</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/list/cs.DS/recent">algorithms</a> looks like. 
        I'm also taking summer courses on macroeconomics, introductory psych, programming 
        paradigms, mathematical modelling, and brushing up on my French grammar. If any of this sounds interesting, 
        <a href="mailto:tkumar@college.harvard.edu"
          >drop me a note.</a
        >
      </p>

      <h3>Future</h3>
      <p class="notop">Though I came into college intent on a PhD in computer science followed 
      by a career in technology, I am currently pretty enamored with economics and statistics, and 
      am considering a career in the academy. I'd like to spend a few years in each of Shanghai, Paris, São Paulo and Sydney no matter how the next few decades play out.
      </p>


      <!-- <h3>Hobbies</h3>
      <p class="notop">
        When I'm not working, I'm breakdancing or playing golf.
        I'm currently working on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Lf9CoTh_Kk">windmill</a>. Then, I want to learn <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14WfVM98qGA?t=226">swipes</a>, <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ovtfld_ZyCs?t=165">90s</a>, <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehzSu7FzSCk&t=5">turtle spins</a>, and <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RQcjrUbnIU?t=42">handhops</a>.
        I'm a scratch golfer, as living in Abu Dhabi gave me
        plenty of sunshine in which to practise. California, where I spent much of my gap year, 
        was also an ideal place to do both things.
