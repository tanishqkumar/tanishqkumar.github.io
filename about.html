<p>I'm an 18 year old on a gap year in San Francisco, working on <a href="https://github.com/tanishqkumar">software projects </a>while running <a href="careerfear.org">an education equity nonprofit.</a>
  Next year, I start at Harvard.

<h3>Cultural Background</h3>
<p class="notop">I have been to school with sons of Guatemalan immigrants and Emirati oyster farmers, with the daughters of Indian
  cobblers and British royalty. Through a childhood spent relocating—not by choice—from Kentucky to New York to Ohio,
  then New Delhi to Abu Dhabi, then London and now San Francisco, my identity has been molded by communities
  where diversity and difference are seen as opportunities, not threats. Ethnically, I'm Indian. Officially, I'm an American. Culturally, though, the phrase "global citizen"
  has become far more to me than a throwaway platitude.
</p>

<h3>Academic and Educational Background</h3>
<p class="notop">I spent the first two years of high school at Cranleigh, Abu Dhabi, and the second two at Westminster School, London.
  I took A-levels in Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. During my tenure in London, I spoke in Westminster Abbey and went clubbing in Shoreditch,
  debated with Nobel Laureates and drank more than I'd like to admit. People often ask me where I call home. The answer is London. I loved the UK
  enough to have considered taking up my offer to study physics at the University of Cambridge, before deciding to spend those years
  stateside instead. I'm forever grateful to Westminster for leaving me with a strong interest in the mathematical sciences, and a
  unapolagetically contrarian way of thinking.
</p>

<h3>CareerFear</h3>
<p class="notop">People don't spend enough time thinking critically about what they want to do with their lives. And for many, this
  is because they don't have the resources to be able to. <a href="careerfear.org">CareerFear</a> is a nonprofit that works with underfunded high schools
  and students from modest backgrounds, offering high-quality careers and higher education counselling. I started it as a
  bedroom experiment in Abu Dhabi in 2015, and it has since grown into a team of 126 volunteers in 14 countries that have worked
  directly with 7,000+ students, impacted 45,000+ more. I'm grateful to have received widespread recognition from this work, from being featured
  on <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/videos/us/2019/05/14/champions-for-change-chris-cuomo-mattie-stepanek-vpx.cnn/video/playlists/life-questions-champs-change/">CNN</a> and <a href="https://gulfnews.com/uae/career-site-for-teens-in-uae-launched-1.2057273">Gulf News,</a>
  <a href="https://careerfear.org/press/">amongst others</a>, to winning <a href="https://careerfear.org/press/">international awards for entrepreneurship.</a>
</p>

<h3>Future Goals</h3>
<p class="notop">Given my work in enabling careers counselling, it would be hypocritical of me not to think deeply about what
  I want to do with my life. Partly out of fear of settling for finance or consulting, and partly due to
  some misguided sense of duty, I'm thinking of doing a PhD in Physics or Computer Science after undergrad.
  Then maybe working at a startup investigating climate engineering, virtual reality, proof-writing software, bioinformatics,
  or smart cities. That list of topics I think are most likely to impact humanity in the future is
  very likely to change, and my career path with it, I'm sure.
</p>

<h2>Outside Work</h2>
<p class="notop"></p>
Everyone needs a way to let off steam. When I'm not working or reading, I'm either breakdancing, playing golf, or weight training.

<h3>Breaking</h3>
<p class="notop">
  The breaking community is comprised largely of minorities and inner-city youth,
   many of whom share life experiences very different to my own. Because of that, there's an enormous amount I learn everytime I go out with them. At the moment,
   So far, I have foundational footwork (2, 3, 4, 5, 6 steps, CCs, zulu spins, coffee grinders), toprock (front/back/side steps, shuffles, Indian steps),
   and freezes (pilot, ninja, baby) down well, and am perfecting my <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Lf9CoTh_Kk">windmill</a>
   at the moment as my first power move. Then, I want to learn<a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14WfVM98qGA?t=226"> swipes</a>, <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ovtfld_ZyCs?t=165">90s</a>
   , <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehzSu7FzSCk&t=5">turtle spins</a>, and <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RQcjrUbnIU?t=42">handhops</a>.
   Having people lose their minds when you start breakdancing at a club/party is always funny to watch. If you've ever seen someone do it,
   it comes as no surprise that breakdancing is a form of HIIT (cardio) and also pushes your isometric muscular strength to its
   limits.

</p>

<h3>Golf</h3>
<p class="notop">
  Begrudgingly, I started playing golf at my father's request age 11. Over time, it grew on me--to the point that after school finished
  at 4pm every day in Abu Dhabi, I'd head down to the golf course near my house and practise for 3 hours before heading home,
  often getting a full round in every day. I did this for around 2 years without faily, and was able to because
  Emirati courses are pristinely maintained and the weather perfect, year round.
  At my peak, around the ages of 15-16, I played off a 0.3 (scratch) handicap and competed nationally,
   but I haven't picked up my clubs in almost a year, so would probably shoot around 80 if dropped on a golf course at this very
   moment. That said, I'm definitely looking to get back into peak golf shape during my gap year.
</p>

<h3>Lifting</h3>
<p class="notop">
  No matter what any guy tells you, reason they started lifting is to get chicks. At 14, I was no different.
  After a while though, you quickly stop caring about that. Training becomes your time to think, to focus on motions that can--to outsiders--at times, seem
  religious. Maniacal, even. To many, the appeal of a shredded physique is in the fact that it's emblematic of a disciplined mind.
  From 14-16, I did lots of calisthenics (weighted pull ups, dips, etc.) but then switched to weights to optimise for hypertrophy
  (muscle growth). Since then, I've been mainly focusing on compound lifts via the push/pull/legs split, but more recently have been
   experimenting with 5x5 also. I'm sitting at 12% body fat as of October 2019, and around 65kg bodyweight (145lbs for my American friends).
   I'm currently eating at a slight caloric and nitrogen surplus to gain lean mass at a slow, controlled rate, without
   taking on a commensurate amount of body fat.
