    <p>I'm a 19 year old on a gap year, working on <a href="https://github.com/tanishqkumar">software projects</a>. Outside of mathy stuff, 
      I'm interested in logistics and gaming startups, and enjoy reading about world history and urban design.
      This fall, I'll start studying physics and computer science at Harvard.

      <h3>Culture & Childhood</h3>
      <p class="notop">I have been to school with sons of Guatemalan immigrants and Emirati oyster farmers, with the daughters of Indian
        cobblers and British royalty. Growing up, I moved from Kentucky to New York to Ohio,
        then to Delhi, Abu Dhabi, London, San Francisco, and soon, to Boston.
        I speak Hindi and French, and am currently learning Mandarin. The phrase "global citizen" has become more to me than a throwaway platitude.
      </p>

      <h3>Schooling & Academia </h3>
      <p class="notop">I spent the first two years of high school at Cranleigh, Abu Dhabi, and the second two at Westminster School, London.
        I took A-levels in Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology, and loved the UK enough to
        consider taking up an offer to study physics at Cambridge. 
      </p>

      <h3>Future Goals</h3>
      <p class="notop">As an undergrad, I'll spend most of my free time working on software projects
        tackling problems in fields as diverse as waste management, financial access and game engines. After a PhD in
        computer science, I hope to start deeply technical companies (like <a href="https://www.improbable.io">Improbable </a>and <a href = "https://www.ayasdi.com">Ayasdi</a>),
        spending a few years in each of Shanghai, Paris, São Paulo and Sydney in the process.
      </p>

      <h3>Hobbies</h3>
      <p class="notop">
        When I'm not working, I'm breakdancing or playing golf.
        I'm currently working on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Lf9CoTh_Kk">windmill</a>. Then, I want to learn <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14WfVM98qGA?t=226">swipes</a>, <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ovtfld_ZyCs?t=165">90s</a>, <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehzSu7FzSCk&t=5">turtle spins</a>, and <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RQcjrUbnIU?t=42">handhops</a>.
        I'm a scratch golfer, as living in Abu Dhabi gave
        plenty of sunshine in which to practise. I'm eagerly hoping to spend a few months at the end of this year
        learning to ballroom dance (the tango, salsa, waltz) as well as to sail.
