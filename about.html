      <p>
        I'm an undergrad at Harvard studying math. I grew up 8 cities, London and Abu Dhabi chief amongst them. 
        <!-- I'm a first-year computer science PhD student at MIT studying machine learning. I recently graduated 
        from Harvard with an AB in mathematics. When not at school in Cambridge, I spend most of my time in London and Bombay. Outside of work, 
        I enjoy stand-up comedy and architecture.  -->
      </p>

      <h3>Past</h3>
      <p class="notop">I have been to school with sons of Guatemalan immigrants and Emirati oyster farmers, with the daughters of Indian
        cobblers and British royalty. Growing up, I moved from Kentucky to New York to Ohio,
        then to Delhi, Abu Dhabi, London, San Francisco, and now, Boston.
        I speak passable Hindi and French. 
      </p>

      <p class="notop">I spent the first two years of high school at Cranleigh, Abu Dhabi, and the second two at Westminster School, London.
        I took A-levels in Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. After a gap year in the Bay Area working as a software engineer, 
        I am now studying some combination of math, statistics, and computer science at college. 
      </p>

      <h3>Present</h3>
      <p class="notop">This fall, I'm working on extending my summer research on 
         learning dynamics in MLPs and mice cortex, as well as taking technical classes with an epistemic flavour 
         studying things like computability (of functions) and universality (in correlated systems). 

      
      <h3>Future</h3>
      <p class="notop">Though I came into college intent on a career in software, 
        I plan to go to graduate school. My research interests are in neural computation and empirical deep learning. 
        I'm curious about how tools from physics invented to study disordered systems can be employed
        to gain insight into what and how neural networks compute, and how experiments on small 
        networks can be used as a tool to the same end by treating deep learning as a poorly-understood science.
