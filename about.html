<p>I'm an 18 year old on a gap year in San Francisco, working on <a href="https://github.com/tanishqkumar">software projects </a>while running <a href="careerfear.org">an education equity nonprofit.</a>
  Next year, I start at Harvard. This is a short biography.

<h3>Cultural Background</h3>
<p class="notop">I have been to school with sons of Guatemalan immigrants and Emirati oyster farmers, with the daughters of Indian
  cobblers and British royalty. Through a childhood spent relocating—not by choice—from Kentucky to New York to Ohio,
  then New Delhi to Abu Dhabi, then London and now San Francisco, my identity has been molded by communities
  where diversity and difference are seen as opportunities, not threats. Ethnically, I'm Indian. Officially, I'm a American. Culturally, though, the phrase "global citizen"
  has become far more to me than a throwaway platitude.
</p>

<h3>Academic and Educational Background</h3>
<p class="notop">I spent the first two years of high school at Cranleigh, Abu Dhabi, where I took my GCSEs, and the second two at Westminster School, London.
  I took A-levels in Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. During my two short years in London, I spoke in Westminster Abbey and went clubbing in Shoreditch,
  debated with Nobel Laureates and drank more than I'd like to admit. People often ask me where I call home. The answer is London. I loved the UK so much
  that I was considering studying Physics at Trinity College, Cambridge, before deciding to spend my undergraduate years
  in Boston. I'm forever grateful to Westminster for leaving me with strong interests in mathematics, physics, computer science, and a
  powerfully contrarian way of thinking.
</p>

<h3>CareerFear</h3>
<p class="notop">People don't spend enough time thinking critically about what they want to do with their lives. And for many, this
  is because they don't have the option. <a href="careerfear.org">CareerFear</a> is a nonprofit organisation that works with underfunded high schools
  and students from modest backgrounds to offer accessible, high-quality careers and higher education counselling. I started it as a
  bedroom experiment in Abu Dhabi in 2015, and it has since grown into a team of 126 volunteers in 14 countries that have worked
  directly with 7,000+ students, impacted 45,000+ more. I'm grateful to have received widespread recognition from this work, from being featured
  on <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/videos/us/2019/05/14/champions-for-change-chris-cuomo-mattie-stepanek-vpx.cnn/video/playlists/life-questions-champs-change/">CNN</a> and <a href="https://gulfnews.com/uae/career-site-for-teens-in-uae-launched-1.2057273">Gulf News,</a>
  <a href="https://careerfear.org/press/">amongst others</a>, to winning <a href="https://careerfear.org/press/">international awards for entrepreneurship.</a>
</p>

<h3>Future Goals</h3>
<p class="notop">Given my work in enabling careers counselling, it would be hypocritical of me not to think deeply about what
  I want to do with the next 60 years in my life. Partly out of fear of settling with finance or consulting, and partly due to
  some misguided sense of duty, after my BA in math, I'm thinking of doing a PhD in Physics or Computer Science,
  and then working at a small stealth investigating climate engineering, virtual reality, proof-writing software,
  or smart cities. That list of topics I think are most likely to impact humanity in the future is
  very likely to change, and my career path with it, I'm sure.
