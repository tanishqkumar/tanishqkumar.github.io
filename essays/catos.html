<h3>ArchLinux and the Duomo</h3>

<p>
  [short history of both linux and the duomo goes here]

  <p>
<em>A short note for those not familiar with operating systems.</em> Operating systems like Mac, Windows, and Linux are 
  long, complicated pieces of software that serve as the middle-man/mediator between the computer hardware 
  that chip manufacturer's sell, and applications that Microsoft Word or Google Chrome, that end users interact with. 
  It is in this sense that they "bring metal to life." They are responsible for doing everything from 
  storing things in memory efficiently and safely (so applications can't screw up each others' memory), 
  executing and keeping track of many calculations at once, and so much more. Because of this, the most popular OSs 
  are often millions of lines of code long, and written by anywhere from teams of hundreds of people (at companies like 
  Apple) to thousands of volunteers (in the case of open source OSs, like Linux, of which ArchLinux is one flavour). 

  </p>

  <p>
    In general, operating systems are one of my favorite examples of a technology that would seem like 
  magic if shown to scientists one hundred years ago. 
  They bring bare metal to life. Before uploading an operating system to a machine, we just have a mass of silicon and 
  chips that respond in curious ways when you poke them with electricity. Afterwards,  we have 
  a machine that implements abstract computation on an electronic substrate, and can do things useful to 
  human beings with the tap of just a few fingers!
  </p>


  <p>
    The similarities between operating systems and feats of renaissance architecture run deep. The most salient one is 
  in how they are both large engineering projects that involve a large degree of artistry and design. Sure, every large 
  engineering project (eg. designing a sewer system or road network for a new city) requires thoughtful design 
  beforehand to make sure there is no wasted effort -- this is part of good engineering. Both the Duomo and Linux kernel 
  go further, though. For one thing, the two groups of people responsible for designing and implementing these projects 
  are often obsessively careful about the aesthetic qualities of their work, going so far as to fret about 
  little unseen details that make no functional difference in the final project. In the case of operating systems, 
  this might be

  [notes]

  sims bw OSs and ancient architecture:  <br>
    - arch because it's resource constrained/has skin in the game (ie. roofs can fall) <br>
    - eng meets artistry -- systems design component is involved <br>
    - megaproject in the sense of millions of man hours and huge teams <br>
    - often involve subtle engineering tricks that are overlooked by users <br>
    - thought small patches/improvements are constantly made, the main body of work is used for a long time 
      by many, many people  <br>
    - the process of building them brings people together  <br>
    - differs from any ol megaproject in that systems programmers and renaissance architects are both "culty"
      whereas, say, [example] is not ?  <br>
    - examples of how large eng projects can inspire scientific progress (duomo -> perspective for sketches; 
    and specific data structures created as needed for OS filesystems) <br>
  diffs 
    - duomo pushed sota  <br>
    - duomo is primarily artistic/symbolic ?  <br>
        - something you thing is primarily for X but incidentally does Y can easily be the other way around 
          eg. software is only incidentally for machines to run, and hedge funds only incidentally happen to manage money  <br>
      - 

  diff bw this essay and pg's "hackers and painters" <br>

  summary/take away ideas 
    - maybe particularly beautiful software will have a permanent place in the world  <br>
      - re: hardy, there is no permanent place for ugly mathematics <br>
      - but maybe not because the lay person cannot appreciate it?  <br>
