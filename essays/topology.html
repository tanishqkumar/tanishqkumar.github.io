<h3>Point-set topology, a short review</h3>

<p>
Here, we work through (in review) selected $a>b$ for any $$x \in X$$ where we know \( a &lt; \)
exercises from Chapter 2 of Charles Pugh's <em>Real 
  Mathematical Analysis</em>, in review for a second course on real analysis I am planning to take this coming 
  (junior) fall. At the end, we have a discussion of the Riemann integral and its limitations, in anticipation 
  of the Lebesgue integral, which is introduced in the aforementioned course. 
</p>

(7) Write the limit of the sequence as \(p \). Fix some arbitrary \( \epsilon > 0 \) and find \( k \in \mathbb{N} \) such that 
\( |p_j - p| &lt; \epsilon \ \forall j > k\) and split \( (p_n)  \) into two sub-sequences 
\( (p_0, \cdots, p_k)  \) and \( (p_{k+1},p_{k+2}, \cdots)  \). Then see that we know all points in the 
second sequence are within \( \epsilon \) of \( p\) by construction since \( (p_n) \) converges to \(p \). 
Then see that since the first sequence is finite, we can find a maximum distance of any of those points from 
\( p \), and call this distance \( d \in \mathbb{R} \). 
Then we can let \( \delta = \text{max}(d, \epsilon)+1   \) to get that 
\(p_i \in B_\delta(p) \) for all \( p_i \in (p_n) \), as required. 

<br><br>
(10) Consider, WLOG
(the same idea goes for decreasing sequences) an increasing sequence, \( (p_n) \in \mathbb{R} \).
Assume it is bounded. Then by the LUB property of the real numbers, it has a supremum, call it 
\( p \). To see this is in fact the limit of the sequence, fix an \( \epsilon > 0 \) and see that eventually 
\( (p_n) \) must be \( \epsilon-\text{close} \) to the LUB because if it was never that close, you could 
find a tighter upper bound, \( p' \), for the sequence. This would contradict the
 fact that \( p\) is the <em>least</em> upper bound. Therefore 
\( (p_n) \) converges to \( p \), as required. 


<br><br>
(11)(a) Let \( (x_n) \in \mathbb{R} \) be a sequence, and we seek to find a monotone subsequence. Call a natural number 
\( x_n \) "nice" if \(m > n \implies x_m > x_n \). That is, if every number after \( x_n \) is strictly 
larger than it. Then see that either our sequence \( (x_n) \) has finitely many "nice" numbers or not. 
<br><br>
If it does, take some \( x_k, k > n \) for \(x_n \) the final "nice" number. Then we are guaranteed that there exists some 
\( x_{k+1} \) that is smaller than or equal to \( x_k \) because \( x_k \) is not nice. And same with \( x_{k+1} \) 
inductively, to generate an infinite sequence of non-increasing numbers. 
<br><br>
If \( (x_n) \) has infinitely many "nice" numbers, then those form a non-decreasing sequence since each is 
greater than the last, by definition of "nice." Therefore, either way, our sequence \( (x_n) \) has 
a monotone subsequence, as required. <br><br>

(b) Every subsequence of a bounded sequence is also bounded, and so if we take a subsequence of \( (x_n) \)
that is monotone, we can use (10) to see that subsequence converges, and thus \( (x_n) \) has a convergent 
subsequence. <br><br>

(c) The fact that every bounded sequence has a convergent subsequence that we just proved above is exactly equivalent to 
Bolzano-Weierstrass for \( n=1 \). <br><br> 

(d) Heine-Borel states that sequentially compact \( \iff \) closed and bounded. A metric space \( (X, d) \) is 
sequentially compact if every sequence within it converges to a limit <em>in the same metric space</em>. BW
just gives that every bounded sequence in the reals has a convergent subsequence, which isn't enough to 
establish sequential compactness of the reals due to the boundedness condition (in fact, the reals do 
not comprise a compact set), so this does not help us get a proof of Heine-Borel. 


<br><br>
(13) Fix arbitrary \( \epsilon > 0 \) and \( x_0 \in M \). We seek a \( \delta \) such that 
\(|x-x_0| &lt; \delta \implies |f| &lt; \epsilon \)
