<h3>Get into grad school the easy way</h3>

<p>My general life philosophy: figure out the 1-2 most important things that determine the outcome of interest, 
ignore absolutely everything else. For grad schools, the 2 most important things are:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Quality of recommendation letters</li>
    <li>Demonstrated research experience/competence</li>
</ol>

Realization --> one thing is necessary and sufficient to satisfy both of these: conducting serious and interesting research worthy of note. 

<h4>Everything else</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Undergraduate grades</li>
    <li>Prestigious clubs/internships</li>
    <li>Fellowships and awards</li>
    <li>Statement of purpose</li>
</ul>

<h4>My approach</h4>

<p>I decided to apply to grad school about a year ahead of my application. I realized there were a number of things working against me:</p>

<ul>
    <li>I had below-average grades/GPA for my school because I enjoyed taking hard classes that pushed me beyond my abilities</li>
    <li>I was applying for the most competitive subfield of the most competitive PhD discipline (ML, in CS)</li>
    <li>I am an Asian male</li>
    <li>I did not take part in any major competitions as an undergrad (Putnam, ICPC, etc)</li>
    <li>I didn't apply for any fellowships/awards as an undergrad (Goldwater, Herschel-Smith) or even 
        during grad school applications (Hertz, Soros, NSF, etc)
    </li>
</ul>

<p>My thesis: <i>All of the above is part of "everything else." I cannot compete on everything else, because I won't win. 
    The only way I win is by doing high-quality research while others are wasting time 
    preparing for fellowship interviews or bending over 
    backwards to keep their 4.0 intact. It is the only possible way I win.</i></p>

<p>The actionable strategy: I maniacally doubled down on the 1-2 most important things. Both of these
are implied by simply obsessing over your research. Having, writing down, implementing, and communicating lots 
and lots of experiments (tens of thousands of lines of failed pytorch/proofs that never see the light of day)
is sufficient to publish good scientific papers, thereby impressing your advisors in the process.</p>

--> what might "a system of research" look like outside ML, eg. in math/physics/a lab science 

<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Applied to 6 schools — Stanford, MIT, Berkeley, CMU, UW, Princeton — accepted everywhere for 
a CS PhD (working on machine learning, specifically language models).</p>

<h4>Action plan</h4>

<p>For the year before applying to grad school:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Skip classes if they don't inspire you</li>
    <li>Don't waste time apply to internships, awards, or fellowships if you don't *need* to (eg. for the money)</li>
    <li>Don't sweat the SOP too much</li>
    <li>Read, digest, and take notes on hundreds of important papers</li>
    <li>Have tons of follow-up ideas</li>
    <li>Make good systems (eg. internal PyTorch infra) to quickly experiment on those ideas</li>
    <li>Implement them quickly, iterate, make interesting plots, abandon shitty ideas</li>
    <li>Send cold emails with these plots to cracked grad students you admire</li>
    <li>Get mentored by these grad students, impress the hell out of them</li>
    <li>As you publish with them, they rope in their (often famous) professors</li>
    <li>And finally, as a result: <i>publish genuinely cool stuff that fascinates and moves you</i></li>
</ul>

<p>It turns out <i>that's all you need to do to win. It's that simple.</i> All those students -- the ones grinding for 
  and obsessing over the details of 
their fellowship applications, spending months on their SOP, missing fun times with their 
friends to make sure they get a 4.0 -- are <i>doing it the hard way</i>. Let them. For god's sake, 
use me as an experimental data point: <i>do it the easy way.</i></p> 

--> include my bad wake-up/study habits, late start compared to early college grinders, etc. Maybe just include a my story at top.
