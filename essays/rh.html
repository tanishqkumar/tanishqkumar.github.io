<h3>Motivating the Riemann Hypothesis</h3>

<p>
  <h4>Short Version (high school math)</h4> <p>
    We care about prime numbers because many questions about natural numbers can be 
  easily answered using prime factorization, and primes are the "atoms" of natural numbers. A natural question 
  is how many primes there are below a given magnitude. Various functions -- the most obvious one being \( x \over \ln x \) -- 
  seem to approximate this "prime counting function", which we call \( \pi (x) \). It turns out that you can combine many such simple functions to asymptotically reach a curve that perfectly fits the prime counting function, \( \pi (x) \). 
  The key idea is that the Riemann Zeta Function \( \zeta(s) \) <i>quantifies the error in our approximations of 
    \( \pi (x) \)</i>. Thus, knowing its behavior, particularly its zeros, tells us a lot about the distribution of the prime numbers. 
    If we solve the Riemann hypothesis, we can explitly write a formula for \( \pi (x) \), and thereby perfectly predict 
    the number of primes below any given magnitude. That is, we achieve mastery over the primes and, in doing so, 
    we achieve mastery over the natural numbers themselves. That's a big deal. 
  </p>

    <h4>Longer Version (college level math)</h4>
    <p>Here, we don't motivate RH so much as generally introduce the relevant technical context that 
clarifies and elaborates the 
      qualitative motivation given above. We assume an undertsanding of some basic complex analysis:
     Cauchy's and the Residue theorems, infinite and canonical products, analytic continuation of complex functions, 
    and exposure to Fourier series. This explanation is basically a TL;DR of Mazur and Stein's 
    excellent exposition of RH <a href="http://www.iakovlev.org/zip/gr1.pdf">here</a>. 
    Here's a formal statement. 

    \[ \text{(Riemann Hypothesis.)} \ \ \forall z \in \mathbb{C}\setminus \{ -2\mathbb{N} \}, \zeta(z) = 0 \implies \text{Re}(z) = {1\over 2} \]

    More informally, it claims that all nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function live on a vertical line of the complex
    plane defined by numbers with real part one half, where this line is often referred to as the "critical line." </p>
