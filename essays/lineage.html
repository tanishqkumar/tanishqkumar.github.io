<h3>Heritage, Apprenticeship and Lineage in Science</h3>

<p>
<blockquote cite="Cicero">
  To be ignorant of what occurred before you were born is to remain always a 
  child. For what is the worth of human life, unless it is woven into the life of our ancestors
   by the records of history?
  </blockquote>

  Sense of connection that many of the best professional scientists feel with those who came before them. 
  Something along the lines of "our forefathers broke their backs day in and day out for decades so that 
  we could enjoy the fruits of their labour, so we have a moral obligation to push ourselves"

  Professional scientists have a moral duty to do research 
  Selfish view of "I'm doing X because I enjoy it"? Morally different from stamp collecting?
