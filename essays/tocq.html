<h3>Tocqueville and the American experiment</h3>

<p>
  <i>This is a modified version of an essay I submitted for a class on social theory. Alexis de Tocqueville was a french 
  diplomat of the 19th century who was sent from France to document the American prison system. 
  Instead, Tocqueville foresaw how American-style-democracy was going to engulf Europe, and spent his time in the 
  United States documenting how Americans govern themselves democratically. The work he produced is called 
  <b>Democracy in America</b>, and this essay is an argument based on that book. <b>Democracy in America</b> is the 
  only book from that class on social theory (where we read Smith, Marx, Kant, Hegel, etc) that substantively
  changed my outlook on the world. It did so by convincing me that American exceptionalism was justified, and that
  the United States <b>is</b> qualitatively different from other countries, in that people with no culture or heritage in 
  common somehow opted to live alongside each other sharing nothing but some abstract moral values written down on a piece 
  of paper. And, somehow, <b>this worked</b>. Here, I explicate this train of thought more fully, likening the 
  United States to a social experiment, writ large. I removed citations, but the 
language and argument is still a little formal compared to essays
 I write specifically to put on this website. All quotations are taken directly from the 
 text. Do forgive 
the pomp; alas -- it was written for a social theory class, and when in Rome...</i>
</p>

<p>American exceptionalism is defined as the belief that the United States is qualitatively and 
  inherently different from other nations.
 Here, drawing from Tocqueville, who coined the phrase in Democracy in America, I argue that this 
 belief is, in some ways, justified, 
 on the grounds of the United States being akin to a social experiment in political philosophy. 
 This is made especially clear when Tocqueville contrasts 
 the democracy once present in France (pre-restoration) with that in the United States. 
 Beyond examining the causes of this exceptionalism, we discuss the ways in which 
 those causes manifest themselves in modern America, whether that be in the form of 
 school shootings or consumerist culture. From there, I briefly discuss whether the
  successes and failures of the United States, as a social experiment, and what that 
  means for progress we can expect to see in political
   science in the coming centuries. 
   </p>
   
   <p>In what ways is it reasonable to liken the United States to a social experiment? In experiments,
 scientists often gather a large and diverse population and 
subject them to unusual and novel conditions, hoping to examine the outcome. Indeed, the
 early United States started as nothing but a melange of people from
 diverse cultural and socio-economic backgrounds that came to a new land seeking 
 a new life. Tocqueville himself describes this when remarking “Imagine, my
  dear friend, imagine if you can, a society formed of all the nations of the world: 
  English, French, Germans…”. What’s
   more, the way of life in the colonies was assuredly different for all settlers from 
   that in their homeland, so it’s reasonable to liken it
    to “unusual and novel conditions.” And the outcome of this “social experiment” 
    is plain for the world to see: the United States is an economic and political heavyweight, 
    with this status caveated with the social problems endemic to many parts of the country. 
            
    </p><p>How does seeing the establishment of the States as a
 social experiment advance our understanding of American exceptionalism? It clarifies why the American 
people, who can be thought of as the subjects of this new
 form of intermixing, have exceptional beliefs about their nation. One such particularity is in
 how often cited and seriously taken the US constitution is. As a 
 stark contrast to the prevailing opinion of the populace in many countries overseas
  (where it is common to see the constitution as an important, yet 
  arcane and dated, artifact of history), everyday citizens will push back against
   gun control laws, citing their constitutional right to bear arms, 
   or push back against “PC culture” citing their constitutional right for free speech. Though
    other western nations have many of the same constitutional rights, 
    it’s rare to hear them cited with such ferocity. In this way, as Tocqueville puts it, “the position of the
     Americans is therefore quite exceptional”
      in that this constitutional spirit is more than the letter of the law, but seeps into the spirit of the
      populace. When asked in public forums why 
      Americans have such a fondness for citing their constitution, [5] some respond noting that the constitution is what
       binds together the colonies (states) into 
       a union (united) in the first place. Without it, the states are independent agglomerations of people, with little
        in common but commercial interest. That is 
        to say, the “United States” has a very literal interpretation for many American citizens, 
        and it’s the constitution that 
        gives their country that identity in the first place. 
            
        </p><p>Another way in which the social experiment resulted in widespread perceptions of the States as exceptional is in the distinction that ordinary citizens 
make between government and law. In a public 
forum [on the news], one person remarked how the constitution was so important because it kept the government in check
, preventing it from breaking the law. In many
 countries, the government is often seen as the producer of law and arbiter of justice
, and so the statement “government breaking the
 law” is itself a contradiction. The very fact that ordinary citizens draw a clear distinction between the government
 — an institution they see as very much synthetic 
 and contractual, an agreement on behalf of the citizens, a Leviathan of sorts à la Hobbes
  — and the law, which is the set of rules the 
  citizens agree to abide by, is itself enormously telling about how
   deeply social contract theory is embedded in the culture of the States, 
  another qualitative difference between 
  governance in the States and in other countries, another part of the thrust behind the exceptionalist narrative. 
            
  </p><p>And from where
 does this implicit characterization, on behalf of common citizens, 
 of the government as a contract, arise? Perhaps it was inherited by the 
founding
 fathers, whom, some argue, saw the drafting of the constitution
  as very much applied political philosophy, inspired by that of John Locke, amongst
 other thinkers. In particular, the recognition of inalienable
  rights and limited government are heavily drawn from Locke’s First and Second Treatise of Civil Government
 . A counterargument is that this social-contractual zeitgeist
  we find in many American citizens is instead a remnant of the diversity present in the States,
  both today, but also during its foundation. At the time of 
  founding, members of all races and creeds had to get along to make
   this new society function properly, and in doing so establish 
   norms and beliefs that allowed such a young society to prosper in such a short period of time. Perhaps, as Tocqueville 
   puts it, “These ideas have not created class antagonisms in 
   the United States because most colonial settlers were already relatively equal in status, wealth and education
   ,” another fact that is unique to the United States (at 
   its founding). Again, having diverse people from rich cultural heritages coming together in
    a short span of time on new land and setting new norms is
     both reminiscent of the definition of a social experiment, and also part of the reason the States is 
    qualitatively different in its foundational story (and thus,
     for many, its mission). That is to say, part of the reason American exceptional, many believe, is justified. 
            
    </p><p>The same traits, however, that underlie belief 
      in American exceptionalism, can be seen to be at root of various problems in modern America. The same blind
 faith in the second Amendment as the right to bear arms
  (originally meant to ensure citizens could defend themselves against a rogue government or intruders) that is so
  characteristic of citizens acknowledging that the government 
  is a social construct, is the faith that has led to firearms being far easier to obtain in
   the US than in any other developed nation. As a result,
    school shootings and mass murders — and more broadly, firearm deaths, which
    include suicide — are seen at levels that are utterly
     incomparable to that in the rest of the developed world, where historical documents that are at
     the founding of various nations are not taken quite so 
     literally and not always seen as landmarks of national identity in the same way. 
            
     </p><p>Another such manifestation is in mass consumerism.
       Unlike Tocqueville, who derides Americans for their inane emphasis on material goods, a consumer-centric
 culture is not in and of itself problematic here; instead,
  the symptoms of such a culture — like obesity rates far higher than any other developed nation
  — can put strain on public goods like healthcare, aside from 
  of course robbing years of life (where in terms of expectancy, the US
   has a lower lifespan than one would expect given its world
    class GDP per capita). For Tocqueville, this materialist culture derives directly from equality before
    the law, which, in his eyes, can breed individualism — or 
    worse, egoism. When there is broad equality and social mobility codified
     into the tenets of a society, a major way one distinguishes 
     themself is through wealth. Tocqueville himself also is suspicious of democracy for this reason: if materialism — which
      he sees as a moral failing — is a natural consequence of 
      democracy, it tarnishes the reputation of something he otherwise believes to be a functional and
       successful mode of governance.
            
       </p><p>Though the States may in some ways be exceptional,
         does that exceptionalism imply any superiority? Is this social experiment a
 beacon of hope for moral or 
political progress in states in centuries to come? The 
first step in answering this question is to define moral progress. Tocqueville sees democracy as somewhat inevitable for
 many states for western Europe. In fact, part of the 
 motivation for Democracy in America in the first place was to study the successes
  and shortcoming of American democracy in hopes of 
  extracting insights that would be useful in transforming the soon to be democratic states of Europe. And so
   if we adopt Tocqueville’s perspective and see the 
   States as honing a system of governance that Europe is decades behind in adopting, it’s fair to linearize
    progress in this specific instance and conclude
     that in this narrow, strictly political sense, the States have achieved some measure of moral progress over their continental counterparts.
     This is one argument for the social experiment
      being a source of hope for moral progress in the future. 
            
     </p><p>Another example of exceptionalism 
      as superiority
 is in the treatment of women. In part due to
  the nature of the US as a social experiment where people had
 to work out the rules
  for getting practical things done most
   effectively in a rapidly growing nation, more equal (though still imperfect at the time) treatment of
  women was a wise practical decision rather
   than one made for virtuous reasons. Tocqueville recounts: “The chief cause of the extraordinary prosperity of America
   is the superiority of American women.” Here, it would not be
    unfair to argue that an exceptional attitude to women (compared to the
    status quo) was a symptom of moral progress
     to come, though this must be caveated with the morally decrepit nature of the treatment of both
     the African slaves and the Indians, which 
     Tocqueville also found worrisome, though on more practical grounds (that it would foment revolution, as it indeed did). 
            
     </p><p>The United States has historically also been
       qualitatively different from other nations on grounds of social mobility. Indeed, “the American dream” is for
 many a reason the States are so exceptional. Definitionally,
  we have that “The American dream is the belief that anyone, regardless of where they were born
  or what class they were born into, can attain their own 
  version of success.” Though most moderns would see the pioneering of this
   type of social mobility as unambiguous moral progress, 
   Tocqueville might disagree, citing that it is exactly this very equality of opportunity that breeds the materialism
    we saw before. Smith would agree with Tocqueville, but
     for a different reason, as he believed that aspirations for vast wealth are misguided,
     and ultimately leave the middle and lower classes worse
      off than before. 
            
     </p><p>Overall, then, we see that if American exceptionalism
       is the belief in the States being qualitatively different from other countries, we see that this is 
to some degree justified. However, the very same traits, 
such as how dear the constitution is to everyday Americans, that cause this exceptionalism also manifest
 as symptoms such as high suicide rates and gun violence, 
 consumerist culture, and more. Though there are some ways in which this exceptionalism
  can be interpreted as superiority in terms of political 
  and moral progress (at least in the way that Tocqueville sees it), the most important way in
   which exceptionalism is true is in the fact that the
    founding story can be likened to a social experiment unlike that of almost any other nation in
    human history. </p>
