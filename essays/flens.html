<h3>Fundamental Lenses</h3>

<p>Every week, two of my friends and I talk to a different faculty member at Harvard or MIT about their research. Typically, these are professors of 
mathematics, physics, statistics, and CS. Here is a compilation of things that these faculty have told us 
they found formative in shaping their worldview, life and academic philosophies. None are my own contribution. A "fundamental lens" is something that 
shapes how you think about many fields, in the abstract, and how you approach problems to begin with, rather than an interesting factoid or method in a specific field. </p>

<p>
  <h4>What school can teach</h3>
  <li>Introduction to pure mathematics</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Understanding the notion of absolute proof</li>
    <li>The power of abstraction and studying structure divorced from context</li>
  </ul>
  
  <li>Probability and statistics</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Limitations of empiricism, and associated philosophy</li>
    <li>Comparing the formal study of mathematical probability to probability calculations done by real-life practitioners
      who live under opacity and uncertainty</li>
    <li>Learning epistemic humility, and when to avoid calculating probabilities in the first place</li>
  </ul>

  <li>A well-taught course on modern literature</li>
    <ul>
      <li>To appreciate the bluntness of words as tools to describe the world, and how a trained writer can sidestep such limitations</li>
      <li>To appreciate the joy and beauty that words can bring into the world</li>
    </ul>

  <li>Basic economics</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Game Theory</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Contextualizing deviations from game-theoretic optimality using psychology</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Appreciating when psychology is (reproducibility) and is not (reproducibility) a Mickey mouse subject</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      <li>Economics as the study of incentives and allocation under scarcity</li>
      <li>Epistemological limitations of social science</li>
        <ul>
          <li>And those of mathematical modelling of complex systems in general</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <li>Computer systems (operating systems, databases, compilers, etc)</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Hardcore programming that teaches patience and diligence</li>
      <li>Seeing similarities between the cult of systems programmers to guilds of craftsmen in ages past</li>
      <li>A dose of humility for theorists, making clear the distinction between theory and practice (debugging, etc)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <li>Computational Complexity</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Seeing financial markets, biological organisms and evolutionary systems as Turing machines</li>
      </ul>
  <h4>What school cannot teach</h3>
    <li>How much to trust expertise</li>
    <ul>
      <li>It's easy to be blindly contrarian, and instinctive to take expert evaluations as gospel</li>
        <ul>
          <li>It's harder (and necessary) to correctly calibrate error bounds on expert commentary, knowing what sort of predictions 
            are likely to be reliable, and which are likely to be marred by the experts' personal biases 
          </li>
        </ul>

      <li>Developing a visceral appreciation for how easy open problems can be</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Many open problems are just problems someone stumbled upon, couldn't immediately solve, lost interest, and moved on to something that 
            they had more interest in, branding the problem "unsolved" when in reality it isn't as difficult as it might seem
          </li>
          <li>If you have extremely strong fundamentals (understanding of undergraduate-level and beginning graduate-level material) in a field, 
            you can get up to speed with world "experts" on open problems in many fields in a few focused weeks of study
          </li>
            <ul>
              <li>There are exceptions to this, of course, like pure mathematics</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>
