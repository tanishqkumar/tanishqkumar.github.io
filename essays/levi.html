<h3>Self-reference and ambiguity in Primo Levi's <i>Vanadium</i></h3>

<p>Despite at first seeming like a recollection of Levi's coincidental run-in with his past, Primo Levi’s essay Vanadium is a piece layered with ambiguity and self-referential comments that blur the line between fiction and non-fiction, and change the way the reader views the Periodic Table as a whole. The most glaring ambiguities in the text include the death of Dr. Muller, which prevents Levi from getting closure, and the ambiguity present in Muller’s both regretful and evasive letters. Another is found in the tension between the form of the essay—as narrative heavily resembling fiction—and its content, which obstinately insists on its status as nonfictional memoir. These layered ambiguities leave the reader feeling lost in a dream-like state, unsure of whether they are being tricked by Levi, or whether he is lost in a dream alongside them. What’s more, these ambiguities are themselves wrapped in a final metafictional uncertainty of whether Muller’s ontological status is more that of a literary construct and foil, or a real human being. The essay also defies characterization: is it biographical, a short story, a memoir, or creative nonfiction? It sits notably out of place in the Periodic Table at large, in which most essays are easy to summarize and have a clean and swift conclusion. Is Vanadium Levi’s attempt to veil the otherwise quasi-fictional essays that comprise the book under the wings of one that is more realistic (insofar as it is less narratively satisfying than the others)? Or is Vanadium Levi’s coup de grace, deliberately showcasing how thin the line between fiction and nonfiction can be, making the reader reconsider the veracity of all the essays that came before? These are important questions to consider because the content of the material is ethically charged, so its truthfulness affects the conclusions we draw about the events that took place at the time. </p>
<p>	The first and most obvious ambiguity in Vanadium concerns the incomplete reconciliation between Levi and Dr. Muller, where their private correspondence is paralleled by the public discussion over the flawed vanadium. The reader is not sure how to feel about Muller, as “reality is more complex than invention,” (Levi 213) and thus the character falls short of being a full-fledged villain. His ambiguous depiction is furthered when Levi refers to him as “a civilian” (214) even in a wartime setting where Muller his superior. Muller’s letters are also themselves ambiguous; they are not unqualified apologies—justifying his actions as in line with the zeitgeist of the time with which he was "dragged initially along" (216)—but are certainly somewhat sincere and regretful, citing a hope to "overcome that terrible past" (215). There is even ambiguity in how Levi comes away feeling about his relationship with Muller, as the dialogue is forcefully cut short by Muller’s death, something we discuss at length later. </p>
<p>	Ambiguity in Vanadium also manifests itself in the tension between form and content, above all in Levi’s insistence that this story is real. Levi contrasts the story recounted with classics like “The Count of Montecristo” and the legend of Horatius-Curiatius (216). He even goes so far as to explicitly state that “this story is not invented.” (221) These assertions stand in stark contrast with prose that would be at home in a work of fiction. This is laid bare nowhere more clearly than in Levi’s description of his time spent waiting for Muller’s private reply, given below (219). </p>
<p>	What did I know about my man?… He would never reply. A pity: he was not a perfect German, but do perfect Germans exist? Or perfect Jews? They are an abstraction: the transition from the general to the particular always has stimulating surprises in store, when the interlocutor without contours, ghostly, takes shape before you, gradually or at a single blow, and becomes the Mitmensch, the co-man, with all his depth, his tics, anomalies, and incoherences. By now almost two months had passed: and the reply would no longer arrive. Too bad.</p>
<p>	This prose is marked by rapid-fire sentences of varying length, and a soliloquy-like tone, making use of words like “contours,” “ghostly,” and “abstraction,” that might otherwise only be seen together in a Shakespearean tragedy. This analogy is deepened when, inevitably, as a fictional narrative arc would suggest, the reply does indeed arrive. In fat, the reply does not just arrive, but it does so “on elegant paper headed with vaguely Gothic characters.” (223) Does this choice of language seem typical for a work of recollective nonfiction? This soft contradiction between the stubborn insistence by Levi on the nonfictional status of the essay, and the—at times—aggressively fictional literary form furthers a sense of uneasy ambiguity in the reader’s mind about whether Levi’s world is real or fictional.</p>
<p>	As another example in the same vein, consider the parallel between Levi’s public and private correspondence with Muller. First note that Levi seeks to “avoid controversy” (212) in his dealings with IG Farben, but later goes on to seek controversy in the sense of pressing for truth in his letters to Muller. Also observe how the company responds in bureaucratic prose whereas Muller’s responses are more candid and to the point. It’s strange then, given the different styles of communication with Muller and Farben, that the dealing with Muller should be left ambiguous at the end, whereas the dispute with Farben is cleanly resolved, and new vanadium is shipped. The perfect antisymmetry of these two parallel dialogues is something out of a carefully crafted story, even if Levi maintains in writing that this is everything but.  </p>
<p>	There is also a definite change in who, between Levi and Muller, holds the greater authority throughout, the essay. This transition parallels the transition from honest memoir to ethereal fantasy. The focus of the essay shifts from the logistical issue of impure vanadium to the exploration of the relationship between Levi and Muller. We are told that Muller was “a person of some authority” (222) at Buna. Even if he never abused that authority when dealing with Levi, Muller could have treated Levi as disposable if he had so wanted. But by the time Muller and Levi are deeper in correspondence, the dynamic switches as Muller “expect[s] something” (223) from Levi: forgiveness. Here, the authority lies in Levi’s hands, as Muller equivocally acknowledges the nature of his past actions. The final act in this reversal of roles is found in Levi’s choice to kill Muller off at the end of the narrative (or simply narrate his untimely death, if one takes Vanadium's nonfictional status at face value), completing a metafictional joke, of sorts. </p>
<p>	A disorienting self-reference can be found in Levi's description of Muller’s eight-page private correspondence: Levi mentions in passing that “It was visibly the work of an inept writer: rhetorical, sincere only by half, full of digressions and farfetched praise, moving, pedantic, and clumsy: it defied any summary, all-encompassing judgment.” (219) Ignoring the comments about ineptitude and clumsiness, this is a cuttingly precise description of the essay Vanadium itself. The essay is only partially sincere because it is an equal parts reflection on the inadequacies of Levi’s interactions with Muller, and an attempt to reconcile the dark past the two share. The essay is full of digressions, such as the myriad stories about life in the Buna chemical plants. The essay is also certainly moving, and makes sure to clarify which details Muller says are factually correct, and which are not, and so is in that sense pedantic. The essay is also not easily categorized into a genre, and therefore defies summary. The fact, then, that Muller’s private correspondence is in this way isomorphic to the piece in which it is contained at large is another subtle but dizzying blurring of the line between hazy memory and plausible-sounding fiction. </p>
<p>	"Why are you looking so perturbed" (219) is another self-referential statement made by Muller at Buna. It sticks out in Levi's memory, summarizing the central question of the essay that Levi must confront: why has he not been able to entirely "overcome the past" (220) and move on from these events of his past "incarnation" (215)? Why do they still haunt him? The quote can be read as meta-commentary, as implicit recognition by Levi of the fact that the purpose of this essay is to serve as narrated emotional processing of his past trauma. This silent self-awareness on Levi's behalf stands in confusingly stark juxtaposition to the apparent lack of narrative self-awareness about how Levi's description of Muller's writing ("inept…") mirrors the essay at large. This conflict furthers the ambiguity in whether this is the more biographical essay or short story, and whether the narrator in question shares the voice of Primo Levi in the first place.</p>
<p>	There is also the question of the reliability of Levi as narrator — it comes to the front of mind when Levi rebuffs the veracity of Muller’s statements in their private correspondence: “not only did I not remember any such conversations…” (224) Levi remarks how “[Muller] did not remember the two details about the shaving and the shoes, but he remembered others, similar and, in my opinion, quite plausible.” (224) That is to say, Levi makes a point of outlining how Muller’s memory is consistent, except for one or two facts. The reader, then, justifiably questions whether it is truly Muller that is mistaken, or Levi. This is the first time the reader has reason to think Levi is unreliable, and thus is one of the first pieces of evidence for believing this is a work of anything other than creative nonfiction. Ambiguity is established by the fact that both Levi and Muller have the incentive to lie; Levi perhaps to tell a more striking story, and Muller to cope with the atrocities he partook in committing. There is an irony that Levi recognizes this incentive on Muller’s behalf: “perhaps in good faith, he had constructed a convenient past for himself,” (225) but fails to recognize his own biases.</p>
<p>	Though the ending is only one sentence, its interpretation induces several ambiguities and so is worth dwelling on. Instinctively, it begs a comparison to the ending of Iron, in which a central character, Sandro, is also revealed to have died. In contrast to Vanadium, though, there is emotional resolution in that essay, as Levi eulogizes him in the final paragraph, building a monument for his deceased friend. That ending is sincere and earnest, and though the language is tidier, the tone of finality makes it read like a true memoir documenting one friend remembering another. In Vanadium, Muller's death does not read that way; the ending instead is much more like a short story in which the death of Muller is the contrived as the sudden erasure of a character for narrative effect, lacking the sincerity of the ending we see in Iron. The reader comes away feeling that Iron is a creative yet biographical essay, where Vanadium at times veers closer to a short story. </p>
<p>	In a similar way, the final sentence of the essay is actually the natural conclusion of the public and private dialogues Levi has with Muller and Farben. The letters with Farben are very practical and realistic, imploring IG Farben to examine their shipment of chemicals. The private letters between Levi and Muller become more emotionally charged until Levi concludes he is dissatisfied with Muller’s response and begins drafting a final response. When considering the “what to do?” (223) In response, Levi goes on a tangent, waxing lyrical about “loving thy enemies” and “overcoming the past.” (223) It is at this point that the transition from nonfiction (a logistical dispute over a chemical shipment) to quasi-fiction (poetic vacillations inside the narrator's mind) begins, reaching its crest when the author begins “preparing a reply.” (224) The fact that Levi is emphasized to have “set about…preparing” (emphasis my own) is suggestive of the fact that he will not finish preparing this reply.</p>
<p>	This read is justified in this suspicion when observing Levi dive deep into fictional and religious tropes like those of “the armed,” “heroes” and “judging thy enemy.” (225) Recall that the reader begins the essay with their feet firmly grounded in reality, that of elemental vanadium and its use in varnish. But slowly, Levi’s reflections on his time at Auschwitz, the very thoughts that Levi attempts to silence — those “of the kind that refuses to be pushed aside” (212) — have transformed the story from focusing on the dialogue with IG Farben (the nominal narrative thrust), into focusing on that with Muller. The recollections of Levi’s past “incarnation” have grown on him like a tumor, culminating in metastasis, foreshadowing a forced excision that comes in the form of Muller’s death. The reader is left wondering whether this conveniently jarring timing marks the actual death of a human, or is a metafictional reminder that Muller is a literary construct after all. In this way, the ending’s contrasting messages in form and content comprise a self-aware joke on Levi’s part, reminding the reader of the thin and often arbitrary lines between fiction and nonfiction, between memories and reality.</p>
<p>	The unsatisfying ending seems at first to be evidence for Vanadium being one of the more nonfictional essays in the Periodic Table. A closer reading, however, sees its unpunctuated and linear form, a simple sentence that reads matter-of-factly, as the words a hypnotist utters to wake their subject up from a trance-like state. Primo Levi is a magician interleaving tension between form and content, and distancing himself just enough from the narrative voice of this essay to leave the reader reeling under the weight of the layered ambiguity latent in <i>Vanadium</i>.</p>
