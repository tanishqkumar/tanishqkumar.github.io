<h3>Patent Law and Intellectual Property</h3>

<p>
I'm taking a course on patent law and intellectual property 
at Harvard Law School. It has turned out to be one of my favorite courses at Harvard. The course is surprisingly 
lucid and self-contained, and makes sense even without a background in legal theory or the fundamentals of 
American Law. Some of the notes I took here might be relevant for those without a legal background who want to 
learn more about intellectual property in the field. Most of these are real time scratch notes, and will be 
filled out and formalized in the coming weeks. 

<ul><b>Lecture 1</b></ul>
<li>[TODO]</li>


<ul><b>Lecture 2</b></ul>

<li>notion of “independent claim” that files a claim that stands for itself as an innovation</li>
	“antecedent basis” use in a claim to relate objects together (cheese melted on said patty)
related past inventions called “prior art”
<li>dependent claims can be written as independent claims by inserting the original claim </li>

<li>transition element makes big different on whether a claim infringes on another one: what your element comprises of (open — fuck over others if they use ABC at all as a subset of their elements), consisting of (closed, so others only infringe if they use ONLY the elements you describe); so most people use “comprise”</li>

<li>drafting claims is about catching infringers in the future AND making it novel in context of prior art</li>

<li>patents are only defensible in the first place if they are valid in the first place; broad claims catch competitors, but narrow ones are more likely to be validated in the first place</li>

<li>job of patent lawyer is to push back and ask if every element or combination that you’re putting it is truly required uniquely — ask them how they would build a product that is functionally the same but would break the claim they’re telling you to construct </li>

<li>you have antecedent basis when you say “a ___”, eg. if you use “the __” without antecedent, you may not have the claim validated (accepted)</li>
if you don’t have antecedent, eg. saying “the hand” that holds the cup leads to objection since you haven’t introduced “a hand” to begin with ‘’

<li>look at 37CFR 1.75</li>

<li>claims can be rejected OR objected to (statute vs semantics)</li>

<li>Patents that describe a “kit claim” are attempting to patent some combination of parts that the buyer or user assembles prior to use. Importantly, and to distinguish kit claims from method claims, it is the combination of the parts that is unique, not the method of combining them.</li>

<li>avoid unecessary limitations a priori, eg. “for consumption” in drafting a claim for a cheeseburger </li>

make sure to know the distinction between types of IP: trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights, and patents; eg. in a bottle of coca cola
<ul>
	<li>trade secrets: process knowledge (“information that is economic advantage from not generally being known”); these are used as alternatives to patents because of the duration — patents only last 20 years; if you have some process behind closed doors that people won’t discover anyways and you don’t want to release the information to the public in the first place, then you could trade secret it. these have indefinite term and give protection if they are not “readily ascertainable”, but you lose protection if someone else can prove they develop independently, made public (no matter how), or reverse engineered</li>
		examples are customer lists, internal logistic systems or tricks, etc
	<li>trademarks: names, brands, symbols, packaging, building design, color and sound, and logos, containers and product shape (eg. dairy queen has a trademark on the shape of the ice cream cone) — key is you can only trademark things that are non-functional (there are also “aesthetic functionality details” etc)</li>
		the government also wants to protect the competitive marketplace, eg. you can’t trademark “a circular box”
		original goal is to identify brands to reduce consumer confusion — 
	<li>this is why domino’s pizza and domino’s sugar doesn’t confuse consumers</li>
		trademarks that are not anymore: shredded wheat, aspirin, nylon, etc
			there are also tests gov runs on consumers to test whether a name is empirically perceived as a “brand name” vs “common name”
	coke used to send investigators and see if restaurants would offer them, and sue them if they do — policing your trademark, because otherwise “coke” becomes a generic word for soft drink empirically, and not associated with your brand, because then you could lose your trademark — that’s why people started asking “is pepsi ok” in the first place!
	<li>copyright: protect non-functional original expressions of ideas, eg. music, literature, graphics — term is life of author + 70 years. first copyright laws came under same clause as patents, whereas trademarks are not — hence why these have a limited term even though trademarks do not!</li>
</ul>

  <ul><b>Lecture 3</b></ul>

  <li>Southwire v Essex</li>
    VP of logistics goes to rival company 
    suit accepted on behalf of southwire
    VP should have gone literally anywhere else 
  <li>definition of TS varies with state</li>
    NY defines stealing information "used for business" but georgia doesn't 
      so theft of list of what doesn't work would NOT be stealing trade secrets in NY!
      various acts on top of this--economic espianage act 1996, defend trade secrets act of 2016, etc, 
      that patent attorneys need to know by jurisdiction and case specifics, and others that cover eg. 
      defence of whistleblowers who are reporting violations of law 
  <li>DuPong v Christopher </li>
    process for manufactoring methanol -- pictures taken from an airplane
    what is TS misapproppriation? 
      just because you're not doing anything illegal, doesn't mean you're not misappropriating a trade secret 
      dupond did everything reasonable to protect
      ultimately ruled to protect dupont for the sake of precedent
    proper means for acquiring independent, RE, with honest acq, observation in use, obtained 
    from published sources 
    courts do look at industry custom, too 
  <li>would the ruling be the same in present day? </li>
    what if satellite imagery was in the public domain? this might be difference today 
      thus "improper acquisition" depends on circumstances
  <li>important to contrast patent and trade secrets </li>
    patent attorneys often inform their clients on which to apply for, as well as 
    applying the application 
    patents educate competitors 
    employee turnover, difficulty of keeping secret (eg. if you can't, then patent it)
    ancillary concerns -- eg. patent protection helps raise VC 
  <li>recap: info that provides 1) ec adv 2) reasonable measures to keep it secret, it's legally protected by TS </li>
  <li>recall patents require enablement as criterion (someone who "reasonably" knows what is going on can construct the patented </li>
  product from scratch)

  <li>now a pivot to focus on utility patents; we're going to now spend our time discussing the new laws </li>
  around patents (america invents act), but the only cases we have to discuss are those under the old law, 
  so it's likely to be a bit confusing. 
  <li>UP under AIA requires NOVELTY. what does this mean? </li>
    important diff: foreign and intl application for a patent 
    lots of this stuff contained in 35 USC 
    paris convention for priority of applications allows you to collapse all participating countries' application time 
    to the earliest filing time for a particular patent 
    one looks for prior art before the "effective filing date", which matters for this reason 
      EfD can be several years before actual filing date if you do it right!
      lifecycle: 
        provisional app, app, publisation 18 mos in, notice of allowence, issuance, maintenance fees, then public after 20 years

  <li>AIA 102a2 is big! f2invent -> f2file change for US </li>
  <li>prior art is not just prior patents, 102a1 says it can be publications, on sale material, public uses, </li>
  and "otherwise available of the public" (new addition to AIA). on sale in another country doesn't apply, 
  but publication does, etc. 
  <li>pfaff vs wells is an important timeline case to illustrate these AIA facts in action </li>
    <li>even though pfaff didn't file a patent app until years after it was conceived, he had evidence it was 
      conceived much earlier and so had some modicum of protection (footnote p83-90 recounds this)
    </li>

    







<ul><b>Questions</b></ul>
  <li>case law vs statute q asked meaning</li>
  <li>notion of literal infringement? what are other types?</li>
  <li>what are “means claims”?</li>
  <li>a claim that covers any part that serves a particular function</li>
  <li>“means” typically explicates how parts you’ve already outlined in “comprising” are connected </li>
  <li>what is “means plus function” language? </li>
  <li>what is “the federal circuit”</li>
  <li>need to know lie out of a patent poster by heart  </li>
  <li>what is "term" when filing for patents? </li>
