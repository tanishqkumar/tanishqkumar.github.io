        I think essays are a much underutilised form of communication. Most
        people I know submit that they haven't written an essay since college
        or, in the case of some more technical folk, high school. I think that a
        good essay is long enough to capture the majority of the thrust of a
        book in a small fraction of its length, and short enough to be forced to
        make one point clearly and incisively, without the veil of length behind
        which to hide. <br /><br />
        In fact, much of the reason I'm interested in learning to write well at
        all is because I want to perfect the art of the essay. In short, to be
        able to make bold claims acutely yet with flair. <br /><br />
        Here, I pick apart some of the most compelling or controversial pieces
        I've been sent or stumbled across, summarizing them whilst injecting my
        own views. Broadly, they're centred around technology, innovation,
        economics, the future, and how we're getting there. I concede that the
        sources are uniformly biased towards Silicon Valley at the moment, but I
        hope to broaden the scope of my analyses to other geographies and
        domains with time. As always,

      <h3>Patrick Collison</h3>
      <h3>Paul Graham</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The Lesson to Unlearn</li>
        Our education system is centered around preparing for tests. In other
        words, learning to game the system. Graham believes startups are good
        because incentives are aligned: you only win if you make a great product
        that users want. I argue that the "greatness" of a product is never so
        binary: often “gaming the system” plays a crucial part in getting
        funding or distribution that characterizes the line separating scale
        adoption to fizzling out. Still, startup incentives are aligned better
        than most jobs and industries. It's fascinating that people so
        ubiquitously believe that gaming the system is associated with real work
        because that’s how you advanced in the metric-black-hole-riddled 20th
        century oligopolic society.<br />

        <li>The Bus Ticket Theory of Genius</li>
        He believes that the capacity to undergo failure at a rate needed to
        produce great work is not a product of infinite diligence, but infinite
        curiosity. Genius is merely “aimless, but obsessive, curiosity about
        things that happen to end up mattering”.<br />

        <li>The Refragmentation</li>
        The reason America seems divided today is more a reflection of the
        natural state of things (c. 19th century) than a novel way of the world.
        The 20th century US was one tightly knit by the twin threads of war and
        oligopoly. The latter led to bland products with little improvement over
        time because of little competition (which governments didn’t want
        interfering with war—think Leuna and Nazis). So war led to the rise of
        big business, and technology was its downfall (eg by making supply
        chains feasibly efficient, so people benefitted from pros of modularity
        but not cons of miscommunication).
        <br />
        The whole point of getting a college degree was to become a “working
        professional” capable of doing management so you wouldn’t have to do
        menial tasks like Carnegie did when starting up. Big business controlled
        all the distribution and so startups stayed small. Due to technology,
        markets went global and new startups had easy access to consumers
        through television and the internet. Size became a liability as pace of
        technical innovation accelerated. Then as politicians saw the incoming
        change, policy changes like Carter’s “deregulation” made innovation from
        small businesses easier. As companies became smaller and employees began
        moving between industries, salaries went towards market price for an
        individual—which meant they diverged between people. This was inevitably
        accompanied by a social fragmentation causing the social differences in
        philosophy and way of life between people we see today.
        <br />
        Graham sees economic inequality (even increasing amounts of it) an
        inevitable consequence (and indeed, the natural state of things in a
        free market) of technological development (leverage increases over time
        as technology matures—the same amount of innovation in 1800 generated
        less value than it does with computers today, and thus made less
        millionaires). But this doesn’t mean the rich live well and everyone
        suffers—as Pinker shows, you can have the incentives of inequality while
        providing an objectively good quality of life for everyone.
        <br />
        Takeaway: Why are startups “hot shit” right now? MOAT in product dev
        much lower, MOAT in distribution much lower, lack of market saturation
        with technology—this amount of social mobility is unprecedented.
        Generally, though, in times of innovation, inequality of this sort is
        the norm, and only war made corporate America seem viable. That
        uniformity is not the normal state of things in any innovative
        society.<br />

        <li>Do Things That Don’t Scale</li>
        A classic piece that has become part of Valley lore. Making a startup
        succeed is in fact less about focusing on a problem and more about being
        fiercely attached to a general problem space, as well as aggressive user
        acquisition. Writing code in your room and feeling great about wrangling
        technical challenges is easier, more measurable and satisfying than
        getting rejected by strangers and asking yourself tough, honest
        questions. So don’t fall into that trap. Airbnb went door to door in NYC
        recruiting users. And this initial fragility is not unique to them.
        Going out of your way to delight customers (eg hand-written thank-you
        notes) doesn’t scale, but it helps you scale as word of mouth matters,
        and experience is part of product. The product/company test is a vector:
        it's not just the technology at any given moment, but sales/user
        acquisition/experience is something you can and must be creative about.
        It’s the yang to the R&D ying that pulls in funding. It’s part of the
        test that is starting a company.
        <br />

        <li>How to do What You Love</li>
        Prestige is especially powerful as a magnet when you’re young—it causes
        you not to work on what you like, but what you’d like to like. You have
        to enjoy both the end (philosophically) and the process (most of the
        nitty-gritty)—how can this be reconciled with Cal Newport’s idea of
        being able to love doing anything, like a craftsman? Parents are
        conservative because they share all the risk of your actions, but none
        of the reward. Be careful about sticking to goalposts you determined a
        long time ago, lest you have a life chosen for you by a high school
        kid.<br />

        <li>A Student’s Guide to Startups</li>
        Undergrads will find it difficult to succeed with a startup because they
        have a back-up plan: being a student. The paradigm and incentive
        structure that class projects promote (all work contributes to grade,
        work harder you’ll do better, there’s an unambiguous mark scheme and
        someone who knows all the answers) the wrong attitude about how you
        solve problems in real life. A startup spends many months building stuff
        to throw away. Someone with “work experience” takes responsibility for
        their life and knows the reward is not Ferraris, but the ability to stop
        treading the employment wheel. And people with this experience know that
        you’re rewarded for building things people want, not for working
        hard.<br />

        <li>What You’ll Wish You’d Have Known</li>
        If sixteen year old Einstein or Shakespeare was in class with you, you’d
        never know they were bound for greatness, but that they were just
        another impressive teenager. When stuck choosing between two options,
        choose the one that preserves optionality, which is usually the harder
        one (math vs economics). Work hard on bleeding-edge projects related to
        your interests, and be the type of person where ideas can constantly and
        easily take roost, then act on these questions out of curiosity, not out
        of a desire to “make this your life’s work”<br />

        <li>How to Make Wealth</li>
        The piece that changed the way I think about startups, and made me a lot
        less critical about entrepreneurs and Silicon Valley. While “startup” is
        a new word, beaten to death, it’s the same as the venture-backed trading
        voyages between Europe and Asia during the Roman Empire. In free
        markets, companies (and thus employees, units of those companies) get
        paid for the value they create. Graham claims that a smart hacker
        working at a small startup will create between 10-100x more output than
        the same hacker at a large company if they work much harder and are not
        constrained by corporate bullshit.
        <br />
        Founding a startup is merely compressing the stress of decades of work
        into a few years, hoping to reap commensurate rewards. Until a few
        centuries ago, the main sources of wealth were mines, slaves and serfs,
        land, and cattle, and the only ways to acquire these rapidly were by
        inheritance, marriage, conquest, or confiscation. Part of the allure of
        startups is that this much social mobility—especially without knowing
        anyone—is unprecedented. Startups are just one way to get rich, except
        that they are probably the best way to create wealth (value) while doing
        it. In that sense, leverage and richness are aligned. For most of human
        history, this has not been the case.
        <br />
        If there is a tension between what the world needs and wants, often the
        “need” is really your projection of your value system. But sometimes,
        like in climate and education, there is a genuine conflict, and that’s
        more of a problem solved through organizational restructuring, policy,
        and individual mindset than what a company can do (though you can
        certainly try, as Musk has).
        <br />
        It’s better to start thinking of programmers as craftsman who can create
        wealth out of thin air. Every character typed is literally part of the
        finished product, and will usually contribute to revenue. It’s the same
        as the woodworker.
        <br />
        The problem with large companies is that incentives are misaligned. Your
        value-add to the company can’t be judged individually, so instead it’s
        just averaged across all employees. This is a good deal for probably
        everyone but the top 5-10% performing employees, because they’re all
        getting stability and “prestige”. But the top few (engineers, for eg)
        generate 95% of the value to the company, and yet are being paid the
        same OOM as the others! What an asymmetry. Startups are merely vectors
        for these smart, hard-working people to get market value for their work.
        To get paid, you need to be able to measure your value-add (your
        individual contribution) and have it be very big (leverage).
        <br />
        Smallness gives measurability, and leverage comes from building
        technology: coming from the word technique, the way things are done. If
        you cut hair, you make money one customer at a time, but if you change
        the way (business model or physical technology) hair is cut, you impact
        millions of haircuts that happen everyday. That is leverage, and is how
        startups (we mean small technology companies) are different from other
        small businesses. This is true for Warby Parker as much as it is for
        Ayasdi. Even McDonalds, which isn’t a traditional technology company,
        innovated in being the first one to prove that scale franchising could
        work, affecting the way thousands of other companies are approaching
        scaling.
        <br />
        The problem is that startup returns are not predictable: while the mean
        pay is 10-100x more, the median pay is zero (most startups go bust).
        When founding a startup, you either make zero or get rich. This is the
        conundrum.
        <br />
        A good measure for whether you have measurement & leverage is whether
        you’re actively at risk of failure. Hedge fund managers care about Q1
        returns, movie-stars about weekend box office, athletes about races won
        that year, and more. Disastrous, embarrassing failure is always an
        option for them. Individual software engineers at Google, lawyers at
        Orrick and quants at Jane Street are not in this situation to the same
        extent. The benefit of averaging is that your shortcomings are averaged,
        too. If all businesses were run this way, with people paid an exact
        fraction of the value they created, everyone would work much harder, as
        they do when running their own company.<br />
        “It's common for a startup to be developing a genuinely good product,
        take slightly too long to do it, run out of money, and have to shut
        down.”
        <br />
        The reason politics is one level of abstraction up is because policy
        determines incentives. The entrepreneurs are the great individuals
        forging promising new paths and getting things into consumer’s hands,
        but the politicians decide the shape and composition of the landscape
        through which the entrepreneurs must forge ahead in the first place.
        This is enormous, enormous leverage. Medieval Europe birthed the
        Renaissance and Enlightenment because politicians were smart enough to
        pass laws preventing feudal lords from crushing and swindling local
        merchants whenever they wanted. And this incentive structure birthed the
        entrepreneurial innovation that made waves in which we still frolic
        today.<br /><br />

      <h3>George Soros</h3>
      <h3>Sam Altman</h3>
      <li>What Happened To Innovation?</li>
      I chuckled hearing this in the voice os SamA, who got rich building a
      location-based social media app, the epitome of trivial, trendy, and
      ultimately meaningless, software. He defines major innovations as those
      that make you think back and say “I can’t even remember life without this”
      in the same way that I do with smartphones, even though I was around when
      my Mom had a flip phone. In 1990, only 2.5M people had access to the
      internet, and that’s since grown 2000x in 30 years. Same with smartphones.
      But despite the Apollo mission having the computational power of a modern
      toothbrush, we haven’t seen any major advances in the physical world of
      similar magnitude (aerospace, energy, biotech). <br />
      Incrementalism is less risky and compounds, and thus is useful, but has
      certain hard limitations on progress it can beget. Internet software is
      also way less regulated, with much less overhead than physical stuff, and
      therefore most innovative energy is focused there. He wants policy to
      incentive long-term thinking and reduce risk of hardware startups.
      <br />
      <li>Premature Optimization</li>
      Startups often wrongly focus on incremental optimization that will, at
      best, lead to a 2-3x growth (email campaigns, A/B testing) when they need
      a 100x growth to survive. Focus on making shit people want, then optimize
      incrementally as you grow into the market. <br />
      <li>You and Your Research, by Richard Hamming</li>
      Long talk given by a mathematician/computer scientist who did important work in 
      coding theory, and worked closely with the likes of Feynman and Shannon. Outlines his thesis 
      on what comprises a "first-class scientist". Though Altman cites it as influential, I honestly
      did glean much more than a handful of empty platitudes. Hamming mentions that there is certainly a 
      component of luck associated with what exactly you accomplish, but none involved in determining 
      whether you accomplish anything at all. <br /><br>
      <h3>Dan Wang</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Definite Optimism as Human Capital</li>
        Wonderful piece, excellently written. Centrally contends that American shift from a manufacturing 
        to service economy has real implications for culture and technological future. It means that American 
        society slowly loses out on the culture of tinkering and experimentation that encourages 
        people to think of the future and how it will be built, and puts the country behind in terms of 
        innovation. He thinks having a clear vision for the future (not necessarily a rosy one) is in itself 
        a type of human capital, like intelligence, and sees popular understanding of manufacturing and industry 
        an important part of that. Ultimately calls for more investment in sci-fi that paints more optimistic 
        pictures of technology in the future. Some novel points and a fascinating thesis, but I don't think 
        its call-to-actions are realistic or indeed very concrete. <br><br>
