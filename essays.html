        I think essays are a much underutilised form of communication. Most
        people I know submit that they haven't written an essay since college
        or, in the case of some more technical folk, high school. I think that a
        good essay is long enough to capture the majority of the thrust of a
        book in a small fraction of its length, and short enough to be forced to
        make one point clearly and incisively, without the veil of length behind
        which to hide. <br /><br />
        In fact, much of the reason I'm interested in learning to write well at
        all is because I want to perfect the art of the essay. In short, to be
        able to make bold claims acutely yet with flair. <br /><br />
        Here, I pick apart some of the most compelling or controversial pieces
        I've been sent or stumbled across, summarizing them whilst injecting my
        own views. Broadly, they're centred around technology, innovation,
        economics, the future, and how we're getting there. I concede that the
        sources are uniformly biased towards Silicon Valley at the moment, but I
        hope to broaden the scope of my analyses to other geographies and
        domains with time. As always,
