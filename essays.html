     <button class="accordion"><h3>Grandfather Ideas</h3></button>
<div class="panel">

  <p>
    There exist a certain class of ideas in technology that feel so inevitable and transformative in hindsight that you can 
    imagine your grandkids sitting around you in 60 years time, starry eyed, and asking you how things could ever have been done 
    differently? Here are some examples. 
</p><p>
    Consider that once, not so long ago, software used to be sold in stores, on shelves, in physical boxes. You would go to a store, buy a box, 
    keep the receipt in case the software isn't compatible with your computer or some such thing, put the CD into your computer, and so forth. 
    And, now, it's easy to think: did we ever really live that way? Of course this was inevitable, and I'm sure people knew that even back then. The heart of 
    a "grandfather idea," though, is that -- post-facto -- we wonder how we could ever have lived that way. 
</p><p>
  Another example is paper money. The fact that we trade with sheets of paper with some guy's smiling face on them is a bit absurd. A more ambiguous example is 
  centralized fiscale policy. On one hand, it does seem crazy that a few old white guys do some hand-wavey calculations every year and use that to decide on 
  fiscal and monetary policy, as opposed to a more decentralized paradigm championed by cryptocurrency. On the other hand, it also seems plausible that 
  unforseen issues mean decentralization doesn't work as well as expected, and some novel implementation of centralization is what we asymptote towards as a society. 
</p><p>
      And now of course one could say: well, Tanishq, doesn't any major innovation like toilet paper or the AC qualify? Well sure, but that misses the point -- 
    grandfather ideas are in spirit meant to be those that one could have seen coming in advance, as well as ideas that changed the way things are done in a matter of 
    years. As it began to take off (and not before), the rapid growth of the internet, and the ensuing movement to digital software/downloads over networks was 
    not something too radical to envision. I don't think many people think building the AC was obvious immediately before it was built, hence it's not a grandfather idea. 
    But, really, I hope you get the spirit as we're playing fast and loose with definitions. Imagining your grandkids on your lap asking you these questions is, I think, a good 
    heuristic. 
</p><p>
    AWS & Cloud Compute [TODO]
</p><p>
    Netflix [TODO]
</p><p>
    Of course, many grandfather ideas are not just inevitable in hindsight, but in foresight as well. This means that the reason that any such ideas 
    do not exist is <i>not</i> because nobody has given them a good go, but instead because many people are bringing competing models to market, and one just 
    hasn't won out yet. That is to say, the bottleneck for these ideas is not conviction of founders in the face of rejection 
    and disbelief (like AirBnB), but instead just the fact that no-one has quite executed right as of yet, though lots of people are surely trying. 
    And the kicker is that many things that look like grandfather are ideas are not. They're just bad ideas. The difference is a few trillion dollars, 
    and a few lines in history textbooks.

 <!-- <button class="accordion"><h3>If Aliens Spoke French</h3></button>
<div class="panel">
<p>
  In this piece, I'll argue that if physics didn't exist, mathematics would be uninteresting. That is, if mathematics
  did not happen to describe our universe with the stunning precision with which it does, it would not be worthy of 
  serious study. This is a rebuke of the belief held by most mathematicians that mathematics is a strict superset of physics, 
  and vastly more general and abstract: it studies the "universe of possible universes," many claim, as opposed to its more 
  pedestrian brother that studies the <i>actual</i> universe in which we live. 
</p><p>
  Consider this gedankenexperiment: suppose aliens were to land on Earth tomorrow, and when we bring together a team of 
  linguists to decipher what we anticipate will be an arcane form of communication, we instead find that the aliens 
  doff their hats and greet us in a dialect of french taken faithfully from that spoken in the Latin Quarter of Paris. 
  Our first reaction would (should) be awe at what seems a massive coincedence. But we'd also suspect there was something 
  deeper at play than mere coincendence. Because it's so unlikely that a separate civilisation would have evolved a 
  language so similar to one of ours out of sheer chance, we'd suspect there was something special about the french 
  language. Something that ran much deeper than early morning cigarettes with <i>cafe au lait</i>. Something 
  <i>universal</i>. 
</p><p>
  This idea of <i>universality</i> is really at the core of my thesis. You could replace the analogy above about aliens speaking 
  french with the universe, almost itself a life-like entity, speaking mathematics. Just as a french speaker could predict the behavior
   and actions of these aliens and thus be seen by other humans as a prophet (if they didn't know the aliens spoke french),
   so the mathematician can make eerily accurate predictions about the happenings of our universe. That's suspicious, and exactly what makes us 
   regard mathematics as something <i>deep</i> and <i>eery</i>. 
</p><p>
   In a universe about which mathematics had nothing to say, we'd still have some mathematicians. They'd still prove 
   theorems from axioms, and staggeringly nuanced results like Fermat's Last Theorem would still hold true. And so there 
   would still be reasonable arguments that it's a field of depth and beauty. I just don't think this version of math 
   would be any more compelling to work on than philosophy, a subject that seems to be falling from grace in 
   the throes of modernity. This version of math just wouldn't be universal in the same way, and I don't think would be 
   looked at with the same reverance. Neither do I think this version of math would deserve such reverence, as it wouldn't be 
   a universal language waiting to be discovered in quite the same way. In this sense, it's the very existence of physics that makes 
   math worth further investigation, at least for me. 
   And I say that as a budding mathematican who has never seriously studied physics!

<!-- <button class="accordion"><h3>Is Psychology Legit?* (II)</h3></button>
<div class="panel">
  <p> This piece continues from the previous one. In this sequence, we review a bunch of (randomly selected) top psychology papers and see how much they 
    really have to contribute along three dimensions: 1) believability, 2) unexpectedness, 3) applicability. We do this to see 
    whether the disparaging claims of many hard scientists against psychology and similar social sciences are merited, as well as to 
    feel out what the state of the art in the field looks like. With that, let's begin our first paper review, keeping in mind that even a few papers from a top journal cannot represent the 
      diversity of any field, so any judgements we make may be more specific to the paper or the sub-field than relevant to 
      psychology at large.

<button class="accordion"><h3>Is Psychology Legit?* (I)</h3></button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>While reading a book about the Vienna Circle, I became intruiged by the prodigious reputation surrounding Sigmund Freud as a 
    legendary historical figure. Since I know very little about psychology and Harvard has a strong presence in the field, I thought I'd 
    go through the introductory psychology course, taught by none other than Steven Pinker (whose work I, broadly, respect). 
    </p>
    <p>
      Just two lectures in, I felt like puking. I generally have a rule that I see these sorts of things through to some sort of conclusion -- 
      reasoning that many (seemingly) smart people make this field their life's work, so their must be something to it, right? 
      And most of the time one has a knee-jerk reaction like this, it's typically incomplete and immature. I came away from my little foray 
      with a bitter taste in my mouth, feeling like the course was entirely devoid
      of thick intellectual meat. 
<p>
      For example, discussions around the visual system typically involve a bit of philosophy (eg. dualism as a past theory of sight), 
      a bit of neuroscience (rods, cones, and optic nerve and retina anatomy/mechanisms), a bit of machine learning (edge detection 
  similarities in CNNs as well as the retina, GPU vs visual cortex analogies). It's exactly this sort of broad shallowness endemic in 
  undergraduate psychology courses, coupled with the 
  intellectual smugness of psychologists in their books, and their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis">abuse of statistics</a>
  that is offputting to me. While some social scientists (eg. great economists) seem to reasonably be jack of all trades, much of the 
  (admittedly, little) psychology I've read presents even the best psychologists as instead masters of none. 
</p>
      <p>
      A reasonable counterpoint: "but Tanishq, you've got it all backwards! Many of the advances made in fields like ML have come from psychologists! Consider McCulloch and Pitts, 
      who virtually pioneered the notion of convolution in the visual system long before Yann LeCun came up with the idea of a neural network!" This 
      is a fair point. Let's put aside the fact that Pitts was a logician and this was published in a journal of biophysics and 
      not psychology, and pretend it's a typical psychology paper. My response is two-fold. Primo, my criticism isn't really of psychology as an entire field. I think any criticism of 
      something so broad is bound to be missing something. My criticism is directed toward undergraduate level courses in psychology. Secundo, 
      and more importantly, these important contributions were made when psychologists acted like experimental biologists.
       And I sure love and respect biology, since it's a falsifiable natural science that is both beautiful and useful. 
      </p>
<p>
      To see if my initial impression was because I just surveyed an introductory course, I looked at the material taught in graduate courses, only to 
      find that they had more jargon, that, once unpacked, was equally devoid of nuance. Much of the prose hid behind the august reputation 
      of the human mind. Indeed, the human mind is fascinating, but I left with a feeling that I'd be better off studying it in the statistics, CS,  
      physics departments or at the medical school across the river, rather than in the psychology department. 
    </p>
    <p>
      One big motivation I had for taking the course was in hoping for a better understanding of human nature on the level of individuals. I 
      envisioned clinical psychologists making heavy use of their psychological training to read people like one turns through the pages of a 
      book. Instead, much of even relatively advanced courses in what seems to be the strongest psychology department on Earth seems to reduce to 
      giving names to experimental findings that can be understood by anyone who understands the scientific method and high school biology. Instead, 
      as Taleb puts it, the way to learn to "read people like books" is through, as he says, "working as a bouncer at a club, bartender, getting in street fights, 
      trying your hand at seduction, and at stand up comedy." 
      </p>
      <p>
      Another primary motivation for taking the course was to lay a foundation for more advanced courses that would allow me to read and understand 
      recent findings in the literature. And so in this series of pieces we examine some of the most recent papers in <i>Nature Psychology</i>; quite literally, a random 
      sample of the top papers that came up in the (top) journal when I looked it up. I'm going to walk through the experimental methods and findings 
      of each paper, rating them on a few dimensions: 1) believability (how much money I would bet that they can be reproduced, on demand, and reflect 
      some actual invariant truth about the world), 2) unexpectedness (good science uses experiments to infer mechanisms and 
      make surprising predictions using that understanding), and 3) applicability (could 
      a real life practitioner of uncertainty -- say, a mafia boss, software entrepreneur, or hot dog stand owner -- use any of these insights). 
      If a paper majorly lacks in more than one of these dimensions, I don't think it makes a real scholarly contribution. 
      </p>
      <p>
      Moreover, as we'll see, 
      pretty much all the literature is accessible to someone who knows very little about psychology, 
      but has a strong understanding of the scientific 
      method and statistical inference, as well as the fundamentals of biology. In this sense, most undergraduate psychology courses have turned out useless to 
      the end of reading and understanding the scholarly frontier of the field. Yes, yes, knowing about the Id and Superego may
      perhaps (if you squint sideways while standing on one leg under a full moon) serve as vital "broader context"
      to a paper even if it has nothing to do with psychoanalysis, but if I can grasp 95% of the contribution and limitations of a paper, I am content. 

      Note that this is not the same with other fields. You cannot understand the frontier and future of algorithmic game theory, operating systems, algebraic 
      number theory, or cosmology, without a strong understanding of the undergraduate fundamentals. In that sense, those courses have some 
      payoff downstream (as well as being generally more convincing along the aforementioned dimensions). 
      </p>
      <p>
      With that, we begin -- with a genuinely 
      open mind, hoping to see psychology at its best and have our prior biases proved wrong, as many knee-jerk reactions are. Each part of this 
      sequence will go through a top psychology paper in reasonable detail, seeking answers to some of these questions.

<button class="accordion"><h3>Knockoffs, Deep Dive*</h3></button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>
  The paper <i>Controlling the False Discovery Rate via Knockoffs</i> by Barber and Candès in 2014 is, in my opinion, 
  a great example of statistical theory at its best. In it, they present a new way to identify causal covariates in high dimensional settings. 
  Put more simply, if you have 10,000 genes potentially contributing to a disease, how do you identify which ones are most causally important, 
  given all sorts of correlations between the genes, known, and otherwise? Minimizing the false discovery rate (FDR) of causal 
  factors is crucial in fields ranging 
  from the obvious (natural sciences like genetics) to the subtle (A/B testing web designs at big tech companies). Their new method for doing so
   is intuitive, 
  and in some sense, obvious (in hindsight). That's how you know it's the real deal; a graduate student in statistics tells me it's the sort of 
  thing that will be a standard part of inference courses in 30 years time. Here, we take this paper apart, 
  studying what the core contribution is, how the authors might have come up with it, why it's important, and the new questions posed in the 
  field (high dimensional inference) as a result. With that, let's begin.

  [TODO]<br>
  <p>One of the biggest determinants of whether I go deeper into economics or not will be how seriously I take the empirical results that populate the literature. I'd like to use this piece to 
    dig into a few examples of seminal work in the social sciences, by seminal authors (think Chetty, Kremer, Duflo), and think carefully about the mathematical assumptions their models make, 
    the confidence I have in their results (how much I would be willing to bet on them being reproduced on demand, tomorrow), and the limits of empiricism in complex, adaptive systems like economies. This 
    survey will involve everything from thinking about how much deviations from distributional independence affect predictions to whether use of p-values makes sense in context and reflects true 
    believability, in the Bayesian sense of the word, and more. It will also involve some allusions to, and analysis of, Nassim Taleb's critique of social scientists and their methods.

  [TODO] 
<p>
  With the recent boom in enterprise and B2B software, it's easier now to start a company than ever before. Because of Plaid 
  (and associated clones), teens can write apps that move millions of dollars securely, because of AWS, two undergrads sitting around a pizza 
  have access to the same infrastructure that Netflix does, because of Salesforce, etc. This poses a question: in 2133, when there are 
  companies that will offer services to automate every step of your business: onboarding, analytics, payments, manufacturing, CRM, packaging, 
  delivery, does your service then merely reduce to solving an information problem for the consumer, to hitting 10 different APIs in succession?
  Do they then just pay you to move electrons along a wire?

  <br>
  <p>Finding algorithms for fast matrix multiplication is one of those rare problems that
     both 1) doesn't require advanced material to have a go at, and is therefore amenable to attack by measly 
    undergraduates (though the research frontier makes heavy use of sophisticated ideas from abstract algebra), and 2) is <i>vitally</i>
    important for myriad applications, from machine learning to computer graphics. This piece is my attempt at 
    outlining the current state of the art. 
  <br>
  <br>  
    We begin with naive multiplication and make some systems optimizations to see 
    how fast we can make it, then try Strassen's algorithm -- the most commonly used algorithm in practise -- and then 
    try to understand, and implement, more esoteric algorithms like the Coppersmith-Winograd algorithm. We finish off by 
    thinking about what approaches are likely to work, and even trying to come up with heuristics ourselves and seeing how well 
    they do compared to the current state-of-the-art.

<div class="panel">
  <p>The 2012 paper by Alex Krizhevsky et al. in which he implements a deep convolutional neural network for 
    image recognition, is perhaps the most seminal academic paper that has been writtein in the last few decades, full stop. 
    It started the "deep learning revolution." Despite this, it's interesting to note that most of it's contributions are not novel. 
</p>
<p>
    It was not the first paper to show how deep networks can significantly outperform traditional neural nets for tasks like image recognition. A paper by 
    Ciresan et al. (2011) had already done that. It was not the first paper to show how GPUs can used to train nets much faster than CPUs. Ciresan's paper 
    also was written in CUDA to exploit GPU support. And of course neither has a claim to originality as far as the concept of convolution in image 
    recognition is concerned; Yann Lecun (2018 Turing) came up with the idea of a CNN in 1989! I AlexNet's success is an example of 
    "incrementalism as discontinuity" innovations. By this, I mean that it has no substantive novel contribution as far as theory is concerned, 
    but makes incremental improvements on existing ideas, combining several important existing ideas (depth, GPUs, dropout regularization)
    in a way that makes it pass an important threshold. The fact that AlexNet classified over 10% <i>more </i> images in the ImageNet
    challenge than the runner up is key because that meant it passed the "threshold" for computer vision being practicable. 
    Being the first to cross that threshold (via a well placed incremental improvement), its architecture became ubiquitous, instantly. 
    Alex Krizhevsky is now immortal because of this. 
    </p>
    <p>
    In this piece, we're going to pore over every page of the paper and see how the authors might 
    have come up with the ideas, and what goes into leaps of technical innovation that are so great that other innovations in the future 
    become analogized to them. For example, when DeepMind's AlphaFold 2 surpassed the 90% protein classification threshold in 2021, it was called the 
    "ImageNet/AlexNet moment of biology." That's high praise. With that, we begin.

  This is a question that really bothered me for a long time, since the present is so different to the past 
  that extracting insights that are relevant and actionable is nigh-impossible. 
  When I asked historians, the 
  responses I got were unsatisfactory: "those who do not study history are bound to repeat it" and other such 
  empty platitudes. After some thought, I think there are two more practical answers, on two different 
  levels. On the micro level, because it clearly illustrates the fragility of human affairs, showcasing cause-and-effect 
  relationships between individual actions and societal outcomes, and on the macro level, because 
  perceptions and understandings of recent history influence public opinions and therefore 
  policy.

  are given in <i style="color: rgb(52,168,83)">green</i>. 
  <ul>

<u>FRESHMAN FALL</u><br><br>

<li class="sick"><strong>Math 25a (Theoretical Linear Algebra) </strong></li>
The professor (Arnav Tripathy) was a loveable former child prodigy, but you wouldn't be able to tell given how charming and funny he was. 
I spent around 30 hours a week on this class and 
had around 200 pages of LateX'd solutions I'd written by the end of the semester. This class taught me how to think abstractly, 
covering dual/double dual spaces, general bilinear forms, the determinant as a group homomorphism, quotient spaces, as well as the standard 
linear algebra material. I gained a <i> ton</i> of mathematical maturity, and I think this more than anything has equipped me with the ability to take 
grad economics/CS classes starting as a sophomore next year. Huge workload, but commensurately rewarding. <br><br>
<li><strong>CS 61 (Systems Programming) </strong></li>
Initially, this was a WTF-is-this class; I'd never seen systems before and felt like I'd been thrown into the deep-end. Debugging also took 
20+ hours a week and was very frustrating. The professor, though, (Eddie Kohler) was accomodating, funny, yet uncompromisingly passionate. I gained a lot of 
respect for systems, which I thought was just a bunch of nerds messing around with code before the class, especially when seeing how some clever systems improvements can 
have 10,000x improvements to program performance. It also made me a significantly better programmer through the sheer workload and time spent debugging. <br><br>


<li><strong>Stat 110 (Introduction to Probability) </strong></li>
A famous class for the professor (Joe Blitzstein) is a meme-king. It was marvellously prepared and very well run, and really not too bad compared to my other classes, 
at around less than 10h/week. I learned a good amount of fundamentals (important distributions, probabilitistic reasoning, spotting similarities between problems, 
being careful about conditioning and assumptions) that will be used in many economics/CS classes later on. <br><br>

<li><strong>Econ 10a (Principles of Microeconomics)</strong></li>
You don't quite get what people mean by "Harvard has a strong economics department" until the former chair of the Council of Economic Advisors is your 
freshman professor. This was a pretty trivial course and I should've probably taken 1011a in hindsight (the more advanced/mathematical version) but wanted an easy course 
to complement my other three. Nevertheless, the professors were very engaging and inspired a love for economics and its power as an instrument for change that is making me contemplate 
pursuing the field more deeply, having never seen it before. <br><br>

<u>FRESHMAN SPRING</u><br><br>

<li><strong>Math 22b (Vector Calculus)</strong></li>
Mixed feelings. As expected, pretty light and actually had a good amount of computations (which are not trivial, for all my abstract, proof-oriented 
brothers and sisters!). Feel like I didn't learn a whole lot besides, well, vector calculus, maybe that's just because this course had such big shoes 
to fill. <i>Maybe</i> could have taken 25b instead, but then I wouldn't have learned as much from the other courses, so who knows. I'll probably just 
read Rudin over the summer.  <br><br>
<li><strong>CS 124 (Data Structures & Algorithms)</strong></li>
Though this class has a loaded reputation, I thought it was pretty straightforward if a bit dull. Sure, a learned a good amount about 
algorithms and data structures, but do not feel like "it changed the way I think," as Zuckerberg recalls this class. The quality of the peers and TAs 
in this class was very high, which was great, but overall somewhat lukewarm. <br><br>
<li class="sick"><strong>Stat 111 (Introduction to Statistical Inference)</strong></li>
This was great! Though the material initially felt unmotivated and esoteric, the resources/teaching were excellent and 
in hindsight was taught perfectly; homeworks and exams had the perfect balance of theory and practise, constantly showing us how, when and why 
the theorems we derived were relevant in real-world modelling. Also taught me a lot about the limits of inference, exactly what I was looking for.  <br><br>
<li><strong>MIT 6.036 (Introduction to Machine Learning)</strong></li>
I see now why they call MIT a "vocational school" -- I felt almost guilty taking a course that is so "applied"; this was very well 
organized, perfectly scoped, not too much work and excellent overall. It feels weird taking a class that actually teaches you how to 
use certain libraries and perform computational tasks coming from Harvard CS classes which are much more mathematical.  <br><br>
<li><strong>Expos 20 (Writing Seminar)</strong></li>
A bunch of humanities majors jerking each other off. Very prescriptive teaching style that 
treated us like we were 5 year olds. I'd much rather learn to write from someone who 
demonstrably has mastered the craft, like Steven Pinker or Jill Lepore, both humanists at Harvard that I actually take seriously.<br><br>
<li class="audited"><strong>CS 51 (Abstraction and Design in Computation)</strong></li>
Self-studied this class; a great way to learn about some important ideas every programmer should be comfortable with (programming paradigms, readability/testing, etc)
and auditing meant I didn't have to do much of the busywork that enrolled students did. Overall, would recommend learning this material but probably not worth taking as an enrolled 
students if you've done any serious programming before.  <br><br>


<u>FRESHMAN SUMMER</u><br><br>
<li><strong>Economics Research (Full-Time)</strong></li>
Excited to do economics research as an RA this summer! Hopefully it'll tell me whether the field is a good fit for me, and what the day-to-day life of an 
academic is really like.<br><br>
<li><strong>Applied Math 115 (Mathematical Modelling)</strong></li>
A cool summer class that covers the fundamentals of building mathematical models in generality, from first principles, studying things as diverse as 
traffic prediction, cell systems, financial markets, population dynamics, and more. I think modelling/simulation is one of the rare "applicable" skills that math 
has to teach, and so it's crucial to learn it well no matter where one might end up.<br><br>
<li class="audited"><strong>Econ 10b (Principles of Macroeconomics)</strong></li>
A gentle intro to macro to make sure I have relevant background for economics research over summer, plan on going through this material in a few days after the 
end of spring semester/at the beginning of summer. <br><br>

<!-- <button class="accordion"><h3>Great Expectations</h3></button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>
<br>
<i>What makes great institutions great?</i> This refers to high schools,
universities, big-corporates, sports teams, and even, say, royal dynasties. But the focus will be on educational institutions, informed,
inevitably, by my experience at Westminster and the things I hear when talking to friends currently at Harvard. <i>But the
  principles I derive apply to the Golden State Warriors as much as they do to MIT;
  to the Navy SEALs and Phillips Exeter Academy, in equal measure.</i>
<br /><br />
Let me be explicitly clear; there are a few things that <strong>do not</strong> confer greatness upon an institution of learning. Wealth, for starters.
Quality of facilities--of faculty, even. Connections. Brand name. All of these help, sure, but only a little bit.
In my opinion, they don't really address the heart of what makes these legendary institutions capable of so routinely
pumping out visionaries--the kind of people who are unafraid to mould history with their bare, gritty hands. It comes down to three things: <strong>peer-teaching,
recalibrating expectations, and a sense of entitlement.</strong>
<br /><br />
Let's start with the first one. Groggy, at 1am one night snuggled up in your memory-foam mattress. You find yourself facing unblinking reflection
on the laptop screen, YouTube tractoring on in the background. You're half-awake, blinking unthinkingly,
watching "What do Harvard students like MOST about Harvard"?
You hear one phrase, again and again. And then some more, pummelled mercilessly until stripped of its meaning. "The people".
<br /><br />
What exactly do they mean by this?
<br /><br />
I don't even think the Harvard students really know the answer to that. And that is that the most important learning that happens isn't the kind that happens in class or the lecture hall. That's a mere formality.
A sham, if you will. At Harvard, the real learning happens in dorm rooms at 3am, when casual midnight chit-chat about the protests
in Hong Kong might spiral into a lengthy argument with your roomate--who happens to be the leader of the 2014 Hong Kong student protests.
The real learning happens when you're sitting down for lunch with a new girl you just met, exchanging
pleasantries and small-talk, only to have to spend a few seconds after the conversation scanning the floor in silent ignominy
 after finding out that she cured a rare type of pancreatic cancer in high school. You learn about the economics of oncology--
something you had, quite literally, never spent a second thinking about--over budget meatballs and staling rice.
<br /><br />
These casual conversations add up. Years after you graduate, you forget how to derive Maxwell's equations and the
characteristic themes of colonial literature. But you don't forget those meandering chats that left you stunned,
and a little wiser. You collect and cherish these back-and-forths--no; hoarde them, as if they're rare gems glittering in the dust of your memory.
You are right to do so, for these are the breakfast debates and seaside reflections that laid the seams for the person
you grew up to become.
<br /><br />
But I think there's more to peer-education. Just as time relentlessly bites at your memory of Euclid's algorithm or
understanding of consumer surplus, it eats away at the details that made those casual conversations so magical in the first place, too.
That's alright, though, because the peer-education wasn't the most important part of your interactions with other students. And this gets
at the core of what I believe <i>really</i> makes institutions great. They recalibrate your expectations. They take what you think and know and
believe to be "normal" and "usual" and they beat it to the ground. <i></i>They bruise and batter and dismantle and rewire, bit by bit,
your expectations.<i></i> By this, I mean that <strong>they make the sensational seem pedestrian.</strong> This is how top schools and universities become
crucibles of greatness, furnaces that take bronze, smelt it and break it down, and forge it into something shinier and stronger.
If Joshua Wang or David Hogg is your roommate, activism isn't so unique anymore. If you've seen Yo-Yo Ma
drunk at a frat party, he's not a "prodigious musician" to you anymore, just another goofy friend. If you go out on a date with
Malia Obama, celebrity appearances mean a little less to you. If the Fields-Medallist professor tries teaching abstract algebra
using memes, legendary academic prizes no longer seem that esoteric.
<br /><br />
And I've felt this myself. At school in Abu Dhabi, if someone in the country--much less my high school--gets into Oxford or Stanford,
it's instantly national news. Over time, I pattern-matched these students that won international olympiads and started nonprofits in
high school as "prodigies". I put them in a bin in my head as genetically gifted, on a level I'd never reach no matter how hard I tried.
<br /><br />
And then, at Westminster, I saw them dancing at clubs and smoking in the park, groggy at breakfast and drifting
asleep in lessons.
<br /><br />
Very quickly, I came to realise the secret. There are no "prodigies" and
no-one is "genetically gifted". These boys and girls were humans, as much as I.
Humans that broke into greatness through a combination of enormous ambition, unwavering discipline, and
fortunate circumstance.
<br /><br />
In Abu Dhabi, being cross-admitted to Harvard and Trinity College, Cambridge, was a fantastical dream--one that
I wouldn't have had the audacity to remotely entertain, even when alone at night, tossing and
turning in bed. At Westminster, there's someone who does it every year (the guy in the grade
above me with the same choice is a friend of mine, now also at Harvard). A step further: if you win a Rhodes Scholarship
in Kansas, you've made history. You're instantly a local celebrity, the governer comes to your house to congratulate you. At Harvard? You get a copy-and-pasted
email congratulating you--and of course, the other 6 that also won the scholarship (that year alone). I'm convinced
it is <i>this</i> realisation being forcibly thrust upon students that makes them great. Understanding this fact
means that you come to realise that there's really no reason that <i>you</i> can't be great, and that there's nothing special about those that are.
<br /><br />
And finally, members of elite institutions so often do great things because they are arrogant and entitled enough to believe they can.
This is a corollary to the reason above, but is different enough for me to need to explain it as a separate point. When you go to
Princeton or Eton, or work at McKinsey or Google, society instantly--incessantly--brands you as "elite".
I don't think most people at these institutions inherently think they are any better than anyone else,
but time and time again, people you meet will gasp in awe, mumble in jealousy, be stunned with shock, and tell you that you're now
destined for greatness--that there's only so low you can go in life now, unthinkingly and
repeatedly showering you with profligate amounts of praise. <br /><br />
At first it's flattering. Gratifying, even. But over time,
when family, friends, old class-mates, ex-girlfriends, and all of society is telling you that you are part of the
hand-picked 0.01% that will change the world, it becomes easier and easier to believe them. And since "the people who
are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do", this is a positive feedback loop--a vicious cycle. <i><strong>You don't
get that round of seed funding from Sequioa just because your startup is that good, it's also because they saw how convinced you were
that you will succeed when you pitched to them, and liked your conviction. You don't get preferentially hired by Goldman because
you're actually much smarter than the guy who went to Ohio State, but because you come across as so self-assured--bordering on
arrogant--and entitled to success that they know you'll find a way to get it.</strong></i>
<br /><br />
All three of these reasons, together, come together to put elite institutions a hair above merely "excellent" ones. I'm confident that this is as
true of the US Women's Soccer Team as it is of competitive Russian programmers and Korean e-sports whizzes. Look carefully,
and you'll spot these factors at play everywhere, acting only to perpetuate inequality by helping
one generation of winners hand-pick the next generation of winners in society. <i>So the next time that
people tell you that Cambridge or Facebook is an elite organisation because of its wealth and resources, or even the "network" it provides,
know that they are letting on only a fraction of the real story.</i>

<button class="accordion"><h3>What I'm Doing During My Gap Year</h3></button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>
<br>
I opted to take a gap year only weeks before being supposed to start at Harvard. Laughing, always, listening to my father first suggest the idea, and explain how it could
help me "see the world through a different lens" made me cringe. Mulling over it, though, I did learn and grow the most when left to my own devices;
when I was given the autonomy to make decisions about what <i>I thought </i>I should learn or try, and how I should learn it. And when asking myself why I wasn't taking a gap year
in the first place, the only compelling answer I could conjure up was the "it wasn't the beaten path". Not very convincing.
<br><br>
Before I knew it, I was curled up in my bed like a hot dog in a big ol' bun, furiously shaking the last few drops of ink out of a dark rgb(38, 150, 255) ball point, biting at it's
top as I grappled with what I'd make of the year ahead. I felt like an artist lost in thought, paralysed the myriad stories he might tell
through the medium of his starchy white canvas. A good starting point was to see what others did during their gap years.
<br><br>I was disappointed.
<br><br>
Most people did tokenist volunteer work--the kind that feels like it's life-changing while you're doing it but 2 weeks after you get back to your
comfy home in a developed country, is little more than a resume bullet point, leaving the very people you were "helping" just as
powerless as before you visited them. Volunteering? Cross that one off the list. Others would travel, experience culture, and learn languages. At this point,
I was fluent in 3 languages, had grown up living on almost every continent on Earth. I didn't think learning languages, in general,
was a great time investment. People do business in English around the world, and locals in many countries won't take you seriously
because they can tell you're a foreigner no matter how well you speak their language. To them, it seems cute, at best, and is utterly useless, at worst.
<br><br>
Others take gap years to work, to make some money, or to "take a breather". Many people who work during their gap years come from backgrounds where they
genuinely need to contribute to help support their families and pay for college. I admire and deeply respect those people.
Many others, however, don't think very critically about which job they're doing, and end up learning very little, as well as earning very little.
They would've been far better off adding 1 more year of work <i> after </i> a college degree. And as for those "taking a breather", I'm sure they have their reasons,
but I didn't want my year to take away from the early intellectual momentum I'd built up in the last few years of high school.
I wanted it to be my most intense year yet. I concluded that around 90% of people who take a gap year would've been better off without one.
But for the 10% that make full, deliberate use of every day of that year, and the flexibility that comes with it? It changes their life. With the most common things to
do during a gap year off the table, <i>what would I actually do, though</i>?
<br><br>
Searchingly reflectng on the years after college gave me my answer. Did I want to be a surgeon, like my father?
Perhaps work on Wall Street, living a comfortable and "prestigious" life, like so many others that walked the Harvard path. Or
parrot out condescensions towards those that "sold themselves out", convincing myself that I would do something more "meaningful"?
<br><br>
Daydreaming, I thought back to when I was young. As a little person, I always thought that society would hand-pick the best, the brightest,
and pit them against humanity's biggest challenges. If you were "special" enough to attend an elite school, you had greatness
stamped onto your destiny; you'd give up your life tackling climate change, curing cancer, exploring Mars, all for
the betterment of your species, right? Wrong. As I grew up,
<i>I witnessed the best and brightest flock to optimise ads for a search engine, or spend 80 hours a week mindlessly filling in Excel
  spreadsheets for their bulge-bracket employer.</i>
<br><br>
But it didn't have to be that way. If I wanted to live in that world, I better help build it. And that meant that if I aspired to be
part of this esoteric "best and brightest", I had a duty to put my money where my mouth was, and pit
myself against the world's most pressing challenges.<br><br>
But what were they?
<br><br>
Stepping back, I meandered through industries, problems, themes that would be indisputably important in our species' future. For starters,
climate change was a planet-scale problem we'd have to tackle sooner or later. That was for sure. And solving that required a
rewiring of the world's energy infrastructure, a multi-trillion dollar industry. I made a note of those, as industries that piqued my interest.
<br><br>
And what about meaning? Future generations would want to find meaning in a life where all our mundane tasks, like doing taxes and
constructing buildings, were encoded away to machines. I thought back to how technology might help people derive a sense of purpose
in life. If you've ever been addicted to a video game, you know how you can wake up, start playing, and realise it's midnight before
you know it. Gaming, I convinced myself, was going to become more immersive and detailed as the technology powering game engines
advanced. Virtual, augmented reality, may change the way we interact with our world. We didn't have to
travel to France or Japan in real life, we merely had to convince our mind that we were doing so. And that was
something immersive video games could do. Another industry to watch.
<br><br>
But how do we guarantee technological progress happens at this fast rate I've assumed? How do we know future generations will be
as ambitious, conniving, hopeful as we are? We must educate them. When I could learn more self-studying over a summer than I could in two
years at the most academically elite high school in the world, it was clear something was wrong. And my work in education equity with CareerFear has bound me to a core belief that the annals of history will most clearly remember not individual achievements, but generational strides: the kind that only come about when everyone is equipped to contribute.
Could technology make education more personal? More accessible? At scale? That was another set of questions I wanted answered. Add edtech to the list.
<br><br>
And these are just industries I've had some exposure to. What are some enormous industries that I'd never had any exposure to?
Well, how about the industry supported by the biggest financial institutions on Earth? Governments themselves. Military and defense
budgets are <i>quite literally </i> orders of magnitude larger than most other industries. They're just more stealthy. Which kid
grows up wanted to build weapons and technology that governments rely on? But that's the very predicate on which our planet's peace
is built--mutually assured destruction. Add that to the list.
<br><br>
And finally, I'd always had a childhood fascination with architecture. Perhaps it was my way of rebelling
against my parents, who so conspicuously were nudging me towards careers in STEM, to half-threaten them with a career in architecture.
Stunning structures like the Burj Khalifa or Golden Gate Bridge would always leave me spellbound. It begged the question:
what would buildings look like in the future? More generally, what would <i> cities </i> look like in the future? Why are we
trying to make autonomous vehicles instead of more walkable cities? How would technology change the way we interact with our urban environments,
and how did that interplay with global warming and mobility?
<br><br>
So I had my list. I wanted to spend a sizeable portion of the year learning about these 6 industries: energy/climate, agriculture/environment,
defense/military, education, gaming/media, and urban/transport technology. All studied through a lens of how software and algorithms could
transform these fields. The goal was the find problems I could spend my college education--or, indeed, a lifetime--solving. These were fields
that could conceivably change the world--and be profitable--but fields that I would never otherwised be exposed to.
I would have plenty of time in Boston to learn about fintech and biotech, but when would I seriously think about feeding the planet,
autonomous weapons, or machine learning as an educational tool? <strong> Never</strong>, <i>unless I took this year to do exactly that.</i>
<br><br>
Originally, I hoped to work for two months in each of these industries, as an intern. Quickly, I spotted a flaw in my reasoning. How much would I <i>really</i>
learn about energy working as a software engineer at an energy-tech company? Talking to employees convinced me that the answer was very little.
For example--building a front-end dashboard to display key metrics is fundamentally the same task, no matter if it's a dashboard for an energy company to look at how their oil drills are doing,
or a biotech company to understand how their drugs are working. Instead, it made more sense to learn about these industries the way I'd learn anything else
--by carefully reading books, scouring the internet, and talking to smart people working in these industries. So everyday, for 4 hours, I read and make notes,
I meet engineers, entrepreneurs, academics working in these spaces from time to time, picking their brain about what they think
the future of their industry is. Nothing has been as rewarding as reading <i> with a purpose. </i>
<br><br>
But what about the other 20 hours a day? Let's say I sleep for 9 of them, and spend 1-2 cooking, cleaning, and generally
adulting. I have around 9 more to play with. What to do? Well, if I found an industry I was interested in, I might conceivably come across
an interesting business idea while in college. After all, the 4 years you spend in college are around brilliant, ambitious peers,
enormously intelligent and accomplished professors, and the university handing you money for your projects on a platter. What better
place to change the world? But if I'm going to transform energy technology, game technology, or, indeed, any other technology, I need to
be a technologist. <br><br>Sadly, high school programming won't cut it. I need to immersively
lose myself in a crucible of tech, and come out with the ability to build out the prototype for any idea I had--whether that was a web app (like Facebook),
mobile app (like Uber), or more complicated software (like Microsoft's Windows). Think of how Gates and Zuckerberg had put in thousands of hours
<i>mastering</i> programming before they even set foot on the Harvard campus.
<br><br>
<i><strong>But Tanishq--you learn all that during college anyways. That's the point of a CS degree, right?</i></strong>
<br><br>No. Wrong. Categorically incorrect.<br><br>
I thought so too. In fact, computer science, as colleges teach it, and software engineering--the act of building the products
we use on a daily basis--have relatively little overlap. This stunned me, and it should shock you too, since most students decide to study
CS not because they want to learn about the central tenets of computational complexity, but because they want to be employed as software engineers afterwards.
When I spoke to software engineers, they told me that their jobs involved <i>only 1 or 2 courses from college</i>,
and the rest was things they learned during internships--stuff like using programming frameworks (Django, React, etc.),
getting accustomed to designing systems (writing lots of code), and studying engineering best practices (learning on the job).
<br><br>
That sealed the deal. The bulk of my day would be spent learning software engineering. How? Maybe an intensive bootcamp? Maybe by
getting a job as a software engineer? Well, to get a job, you have to know how to do it. And bootcamps were educational institutions,
no matter how intense they claimed to be, I was sure I could do it better, faster, myself. And so I lined up some online courses,
a bunch of projects I wanted to build, and got to work. This takes up around 6 hours of my day.
<br><br>
At first glance, it really does seem backwards. I'm taking a year out to...learn programming and read? <i><strong>Isn't that exactly what a college degree,
  majoring in CS, would teach you?<br><br></i></strong><img src="/static/meme1.jpg" height="200" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><br>
 I'm convinced this is the sort of pattern-matching thinking that
leads people astray in the first place. When you dig into the details, you see that the programming I'm doing is preparation
to build useful, marketable products, not prove abstract computational theorems (a CS degree). The reading I'm doing
is about the nitty-gritty details of industries I may very well end up working in, not grappling with esoteric literature (the kind
you do a lot of in college). Let me be explicit--I am not saying these things aren't important. In a world increasingly
using technology as a crutch, understanding the central philosophies and concepts of human thought is more important now than ever before. I will make sure to do these things
when I'm in college. But before I get there I need to know how to be useful first. So I'm taking a year to sort that out.

<!-- <h3>On the Financial Institution</h3>
<p >
<i>
Westminster and Harvard both have significant pull towards finance-whether that's at a bulge bracket investment bank (think Goldman Sachs), quantitative hedge fund (think Two Sigma), or fintech startup (think Addepar).
When all your most ambitious and accomplished peers are being sucked into an industry like specks of dust unthinkingly marching up a vacuum's long snout, you can't help but wonder what's so great about the industry in the first place. </i>
<br><br>
At the highest level of abstraction, the financial institution exists to allocate capital efficiently so society can be optimally productive. And, most of the time, it does exactly that. The big banks--yes, the very same ones that are so often vilified by miseducated members of the public--exist simply to help organisations raise capital from people that want to invest. In my opinion, they do this very well.
So much so that the US government bailed out the big banks in the wake of the 2008 crisis because the government recognized that the economy would collapse without them. If no investment banks remained, who would give companies--both big and small--access to public capital? Companies would go bankrupt, millions would be laid off. Disaster. By taking money from taxpayers at the time, the US government funded the survival of some of the big banks,
thereby stabilising the immediate economic future of American society (but also thereby incentivising bad behaviour).
<br><br>
The reason that claims about the value of (investment) banking as an industry seem so political is because even though objective facts about the importance of the industry's role exist, they are <i> incredibly complex</i>.
Perhaps an example will help. Let's say we're debating, say, whether new regulations after the 2008 crisis removed bad actors in the banking industry. Many economists will do deeply researched studies, using advanced models, and come to a conclusion
 that the regulations were, in fact, effective. Looking carefully, we find that herein lies the problem. <i>Equally reputable economists will do studies a slightly different—-but equally valid—-way and come out with the <strong>opposite </strong>conclusion</i>, giving both sides "facts" to fuel their respective fires.
<br><br>
  The ex-banker I spoke to—-who inspired this piece—-confessed that he left because he didn’t find the work meaningful. The main reason that so many people hate on banking as an industry is not because of bad actors (people embezzling funds/overcharging management fees).
  Sure, these people exist, but they are no more common than in any other industry. In fact, what many people fail to internalise is that most financial products/services are based on complex, but very sound, mathematics and robust legal architecture--even if it, at times, seems unecessarily convoluted.
  Let me restate that for emphasis. The financial products and services people in Silicon Valley find confusing and nebulous are often very effective, well-researched, vehicles to efficiently allocate society's capital.
  The reason people hate banks (and the only justifiable one), is instead that they exist to help the rich get richer. In this sense, the banks aren’t directly doing good for the bottom 99%.
<br><br>
  The CFO of, say, Walmart, who wants to raise capital for a new service Walmart is looking to implement, or, say, a $4B startup looking to IPO, clearly think Goldman is worth the $10M fee they’re charging for their M&A/fundraising services, or else the companies wouldn’t pay it. And for the investors/execs at these big companies that stand to make a lot of money when stock prices rise after funds are raised, going with Goldman certainly is worth the $10M. <i>So both the bank and client come </i> out ahead.  No one seems to get “screwed”.<strong> Except, of course, the naïve member of the public</strong>, who invests in the company looking to raise money without knowing all the facts. It’s<i>their</i> money that gets channeled into the executives’/investors' pockets (there is, after all, only a finite of capital that exists in society). But, of course, the layperson volunteered to invest their money; no-one forced them to do it. They just didn’t have an "edge" when betting on the market, and so lost their money. Then complained about it, and scapegoated the "evil corporates". It should be noted that there exceptions, of course—-members of the public didn't necessarily make misinformed investments when it came to the 2008 housing bubble, that really was down to miscalculations and greed on behalf of the banks.
<br><br>
  And now to tackle a common misconception: some think that employees benefit when companies raise capital. This is not the case. When a company, say Walmart, raises money, its 2.7 million employees do NOT all get a raise, or more perks. Their professional lives are left unchanged. The only argument that can even be <i> attempted </i> by the aspiring
  banker is that fuelling companies by supplying them with access to capital means that they can provide more value for their customers. More concretely put, if, say, Walmart raises $2B from investors in a transaction mediated by JP Morgan,
  it can use that money to kickstart that new autonomous 1-day delivery service that will then add convenience to millions of Americans and add value to <i> those </i> lives. My response to this argument is: no shit, that's the point of raising capital in the first place. This argument, while undeniably true,
  emphasises value-added that is, in my opinion, too far removed from the everyday human to be clearly meaningful work. The work of individual analysts at JPM and the implementation of the autonomous delivery service are many steps removed from each other, and it's difficult to know if any individual banker had a meaningful role to play
  in the whole arc at all.
<br><br>
  The dull reality is that most bankers are cogs in a machine that is-at best, contributing value that is several steps removed from wider society (like the JPM-Walmart-delivery service), and at worst, actively screwing over millions (like the 2008 crisis). Perhaps
  this becomes more apparent as you begin to bear children of your own. At this point, you start to think more carefully about the effects your actions have on other people; people like your tender, starry-eyed children. Perhaps that's why so many people leave banking with a bad taste in their
  mouths around the ages of 40-50, right as their children hit adolescence and their own futures are financially secure.

<h3>Hard Work vs Discipline</h3>
<p >
  It's 5am. You jolt awake, exasperated. Frustrated, angry, that you-only 7 hours ago-would have the audacity
  to force your present self out of deep, peaceful sleep. But you're proud that you're up. You don't spend your usual
  30 minutes scrolling mindlessly on Instagram like you're in a semi-comatose state. You're on a mission. Even on the way to the bathroom to brush your teeth,
  you walk with a purpose, as if steadying yourself to begins sprinting in the direction of your dreams. An hour later, you find your
  citrus Nike tee soaked by fruits of your workout.
<br><br>
  Readying yourself for school, you pull your charcoal socks up to the middle of your shin like an athlete deep in focus, religiously lacing up before an
  Olympic final. While others frolick playfully in the dining hall, you give up your lunchtimes to work. After school,
  you lose yourself once again in the deep waters of focus. Only when the sun sets again at dusk do you hesitantly-as if glancing to your left and right before beginning to cross a busy intersection--take a breather. You're exhausted.
  But you've prayed to mantras of "grinding" and "outworking" too long;
  this is not when you let up. Another motivational video pushes you through yet another hour of bleary eyed study. As your city
  slips into the depths of darkness, you do too. Then you do it all over again.
<br><br>
  Welcome to the grind.
<br><br>
  This was my life for two years. In Year 11 and 12 (sophomore & junior year) of high school, I was obsessed. Obsessed with
  getting into Westminster as a way to escape the shackles of a mediocre education, obsessed with academically matching
  the very best in the world.
  To a weary but hopeful mid-teen, the phrase "hard work" was more than another empty truism. It was a lifestyle. I thought
  I was a demi-god, subtly fabricating excuses for missing friends' parties-as if my
  paternal grandfather really <i> was </i> in town for his knee surgey-only to spend quiet Friday evenings at my desk,
  in the depths of concentration. I don't know what I was looking to prove. Perhaps it was a former debater trying to convince himself
  that he was more than just an articulate speaker, that he could compete with the strongest math/science
  students on Earth. Perhaps it was
  an anxious teen at a competitive high school, refusing to "settle" when applying to college.
<br><br>
  What I <i> do </i> know is that I wasn't working the right way. Sure, I got a lot done. Through brute force,
   I completed 2 A-levels in 5 weeks during summer. I scaled an education equity nonprofit while
  sipping undergraduate biology on the side.
<br><br>
  But now, at 18, I look back and cringe. I'm disappointed that I ever really believed that
  "hard work" was what forged greatness. That becoming great at whatever you did necessarily meant devoting every waking hour,
  feeling socially asphixiated, giving up so many things you love, pushing your body to its physical limits.
<br><br>
  How childish.
<br><br>
  Some of you may be shaking your head, curious as to where exactly that logic breaks down. We see Musk touting his 100-hour work week, athletes
  doing nothing but train all day on TV. This is what the world has always said. So, surely, "hard work", does
  in fact mould champions.
<br><br>
  Nope.
<br><br>
  I'll tell you what <i> does</i>. Output. Getting very important things done. Productivity. Putting in enormous amounts of time
  has little bearing on how much you accomplish. This is an empirical observation.
<br><br>
  But how can that be? The more hours you pour into something, the better you'll be. Right? Right. <i>If, and only if,</i> you hold
  intensity (how much you achieve in every hour spent working) constant. In reality, those hours I was awake at 5am, working for two hours before school, I achieved almost nothing.
  I could barely focus. Bleary eyed, I'd stare blinkingly at textbooks, blindly trying to
  retain material like my mom trying desperately to hold up a mountain of clothes at a thrift shop, only to clasp helplessly
   as they fall by the wayside. The amount of work I got done in those 120 minutes was equivalent to around 30 minutes of
  deep, focused work at my peak.
<br><br>
  And to get to that peak consistently, I needed 9+ hours of sleep (personal observation). I needed to hang out with friends.
  And so as I grew older and-allegedly-wiser, I turned in my obsession with "hard work" and motivational videos for something far more nuanced.
  Discipline. During my gap year, I get 11 hours of sleep a night (the natural amount I sleep without setting an alarm), with no regrets.
  What I do make sure to do, however, is to have <i> habits </i> in place to make sure that, during the 13 hours I <i>am</i> awake,
  shit gets done. I split my day into three chunks. 4 hours spend coding, 4 hours spend reading, and 2 hours spent breakdancing.
<br><br>
  Let me clarify. It takes me 6 hours to put in those 4 hours writing code. By 4 hours coding, I really mean 4 hours spent, butt-in-chair,
  focused while typing furiously at the keyboard. I set a timer, and stop it every time I go to the toilet. Every time I get water.
  Every time I take a 10 minute break. And so ultimately, to excise those 8 hours of productivity every day, I have to spend 11-12 hours "working".
<br><br>
  And I'm seeing progress like never before. In 1 hour of silent, uninterrupted work, I can lose myself in the deep waters of focus.
  I get more done in an hour now than in almost a whole day of maniacal "hard work". And I advise you to do the same. Like a sinner
  worriedly creeping into a place of worship, seeking impunity, turn in your childish obsession with "hard work". Supplant it with a more
  mature understanding of the power of discipline and habit. The power of keeping to rituals, and hitting realistic daily goals.
  Every. Single. Day. Hitting the 4-4-2 target 90% of the time is <i>far</i> more productive than consistently
  getting only 50% use out of 16-hour-workdays, no matter how hard Elon Musk says he's working.
<br><br>
  Don't get me wrong. When I'm working on my PhD thesis, or about to pitch for Series A for a startup, I will have to work hard AND
  be disciplined. There are moments in life where you should sacrifice your social life and health for peak intelletual performance.
  At those points, I will have to regularly execute 16-hour-days at 100% efficiency. But I cannot do that
  for years on end. Anyone who says they can is lying to you. In those 16 hours, they probably get 8-9 hours of real work done, just
  as I do.
<br><br>
  Except, of course, I do it while sleeping 11 hours a day :)

<h3>On Parenthood and Conversation</h3>
<p >
  <i>
A lone silver molar, nestled comfortably inside an Afghani smile, glistened in the rear-view mirror of my Uber, almost as if beckoning the midnight moon to outshine it. Outside, the night sky sat still, washing the heavens with black. As we spoke, it was as if he and I were the only two people in the world.
</i>
<br /><br />
The ability to have sustained, intense, meandering conversations is, in my opinion, one of humanity’s most distinctive traits. The stones of conversation that most leave unturned stand out to me, gleaming in with potential, begging to see the light of day.
I think that there is a conversation special to every set of people—one conversation, at least, that only a given set of people can have at a given place at a given time. Despite my imperfections, many of which I am working <i>desperately </i>to address, I think one thing I <i>am </i>very good at is finding that conversation.
<br /><br />
But this gift is not my own. It is, as with most other things, merely a product of good circumstance. A result of a lottery of sorts—the “ovarian lottery”, as Warren Buffet puts it. My father has always owned this gift, this spellbinding ability to have
interesting conversations with strangers, to engage people and make them feel valued. Every interaction I witnessed him take part in was a verbal seduction, of sorts. Watching him lead a discussion, no matter who with,
was to witness the slowest of surrenders, the kind you want to relive over and over again, as if rewatching a magician’s hand, desperate to catch the moment of slight.
<br /><br />
But there is no trick here.
<br /><br />
It was with Afghani taxi drivers and Greek tablestaff, Kenyan construction workers and Canadian colleagues that he wove his conversational magic. I was a young, impressionable eight year old, bewitched by his charisma, watching him
masterfully play lexical chess, taking ritualistic small talk and seamlessly transfiguring it into meaningful, memorable conversation; conversation where the other person felt important, special, singularly valued and understood. Unwittingly, they
would reveal, as if hesitantly—but with a whisper of relief—their stories, backgrounds, experiences, excited to share a glimpse of the raw, unfettered beauty dancing silently inside their skull.
Through this, he learned what it was like growing up in a civil-war stricken Kabul with a single mother, and why an Athenian man regrets leaving his lover at the alter. Vicariously, he lived in Nairobi as the son of a famous businessman who was cast out of the house
at fourteen, and as a science-obsessed young girl in Toronto whose only ambition in life was to become a pediatric surgeon.
<br /><br />
He lived a million lives in one.
<br /><br />
I wanted little more to have that ability, to weave that black magic and enchant powerless onlookers with games of words and phrases and hypnotic syntactic trickery.
<br /><br />
I wanted little more than to be like him.
<br /><br />
And slowly, I learned. I learned to ask questions when others would be silent, to disagree and challenge when others would back down. I learned to poke and prod, and lose myself in the deep waters of the other person’s life,
imbibing their experiences as if sipping the nectar of forbidden fruit; fruit that was hidden and ugly on the surface, but bracing and delicious inside. I learned to ask weird questions and give weird answers, to listen and understand as if I was
to be tested on the details of the speaker’s life. Day in and day out, living with my father would beat these subtle habits into me until I graduated from the rank of apprentice, and started to weave spells of my own.
<br /><br />
And I didn’t realise this until today, while taking an Uber back from the airport with, well, an Afghani driver. Because of this gift, I’ve been blessed with an understanding of what it’s like being a Lebanese matriarch running a San Francisco café, and
what it’s like being a Gambian immigrant struggling to make ends meet in an extended family. Through conversation, I’ve looked the eyes of south Indian husbands as they catch sight of their arranged wives-to-be,
and smelled the terrifying scent of lead lining the roads of a war-torn Aleppo. These conversations have been hidden in Uber drives from the airport—sure—but they’ve also worn the mask of hairdressers shaving my head and waiters blowing clouds while on break,
nervous algorithmists coding furiously in the solace of libraries, and unruly breakdancers taking a rare moment to reflect on childhoods spent dancing with their grandparents.
<br /><br />
And all of these are strands of a human narrative I would’ve been powerless to play with if it weren’t for my father’s gift, and my childhood spent watching him exercise it. This is why I believe that your parents control a large part of your fate.
By that, I don't mean that their wealth defines your education and opportunities.
No, I mean instead that nepotism most wreaks havoc by perpetuating skills that can’t be learned online. If someone shy and antisocial tried to hone their ability to weave memorable conversations with virtual strangers,
it would be very hard to catch up with me simply because I have a near two-decade head start. And that comes down to who my parents were, and how they behaved as I grew up around them.
Equally, my friends wield gifts I can only dream of beholding. I know boys who walk with blind, iron-clad confidence, girls who can seduce on a dime. They bear the gifts of <i>their </i>parents, and the years they spent learning them through
the ultimate apprenticeship-the one we call “childhood”. So when you see someone command an audience with ease, delicately but assuredly toying with its attention and emotions, don't write them off as someone who was “born-great” at public speaking.
That is not the case. It was years of practise, of watching it being done right from one role model or another, or screwing up and doing it again—all inadvertently, subconsciously, informally, before they got up on that stage and mesmerised us.
<br /><br />
This is not an essay meant to discourage. Quite the opposite. It should be empowering to know that there is no protein encoded for by any gene that makes a human charismatic. Everyone learns it the hard way—some people just earlier and quicker than others. So if you can’t
command attention like Jobs or respect like Bond, it doesn’t mean you can’t be a better version of you. Much like their childhoods forced upon them thousands of hours of unwitting practise, you can put yourself through those hours too, consciously, knowing the results that await you at the end.
<br /><br />
So, go ahead. Talk to the old man sitting across you on the train, ask the cashier how her day <i>really </i>was. Push a little bit more than you’re comfortable with when your Uber driver is telling you about their background, use every opportunity to let people talk about themselves.
<br /><br />
They might surprise you.

<!-- <h3>Progress, Purpose, Impact</h3>
<p >
  The central question of what one should do with their life is so daunting that it is often inadvertently left as a
  decision to be made spontaneously and instinctively, instead of an ongoing internal thesis to formulate, grapple with, unpack.
  In this piece, I'd like to examine a few articles sent to me by a friend studying philosophy at
  Cambridge, surveying both the social scientific literature and--no less important--arguments from the humanities.
  The analysis will go through three articles, and addresses questions centred around two themes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      What do most people want from life and how do they go about getting it? That is, why do we make the career choices we do?
      What is the relationship between the ideas, values and objects that people crave and cherish and the path they end up taking in life?
    </li>
    <li>
      What are the best ways of achieving "social impact" as an individual? What are some surprising truths and falsities about "making a difference"? How should we
       navigate choosing the highest leverage actions? Why aren't we already doing these things?
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p >
    The end goal is to come up with tentative answers to these questions; or, at the very least, other important
    questions to be explored. I also hope to make some specific, actionable recommendations,
    steering clear of philosophical waxing.

<h3>Hidden Work</h3>
<p >
[TODO]<br>
It's very easy to think that people that are great at things are naturally great at them. Of course, we'll publicly
acknowledge how much hard work goes on behind the scenes to forge that exceptional ability, and sometimes we'll even 
convince ourselves that we believe it, but I think most of us, most of the time, don't have any clear idea of what that 
means or looks like. I thought a lot about this after reading a scene in <i>The Wise Man's Fear</i> (second book in my 
all time favorite fiction series), where the protagonist spends four hours rehearsing how to flick his wrist as he bows
to impress nobility (he is of low-birth in the novels). <br><br>
When I first read it, I laughed out loud, but the scene dances a delicate tango around my skull as I go through 
other books (non-fiction) that hint at similar situations. And I only got around to writing this when, again, reminded of 
much work and thought goes into the smallest things watching a French comedian rehearse different ways of saying 
"Goodnight, Paris!" to get it perfect. Here are some examples of hidden work, to serve as reminders of how 
most things that seem natural, even obvious, to onlookers, took thousands of hours to get just right.
