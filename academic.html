<h1>Academic Learning & Notes</h1>
<p class="notop">
When first learning something new, I never take notes. The first time I'm exposed to new content,
my focus is purely on internalising the material; whether that's a lecture on asymptotic analysis (CS),
special relativity (physics), or romantic motifs in Pride & Prejudice (english). On the second pass through the material,
I'll paraphrase the contents of the lecture, YouTube video or textbook. On the third pass, my goal is to shorten my own notes.
Each pass of paraphrasing demands I "explain" the material in a new, more concise
manner (see <a href="https://mattyford.com/blog/2014/1/23/the-feynman-technique-model">the Feynman Technique.</a>)
 It also produces clean, palatable notes for my own future reference. I've taken notes on a variety of things throughout my life; you may
 or may not find them useful. They're given below, anyways, in no particular order.

<ul>
  <li><a href="/static/anotes/Westminster IBO Notes Tanishq.pdf">International Biology Olympiad:</a> Junior year of high school, I narrowly missed making the British IBO team.
    These are my notes that 1) summarise A-level Biology (a more rigorous and in-depth version of AP Biology, for my American friends) and 2) offer information snipppets that are highly relevant to those preparing
  for Olypmiad Biology competitions, since much of these notes came from past IBO problems I couldn't do, or from important parts of
Campbell Biology (a staple undergraduate Biology textbook).</li>

<li><a href="/static/anotes/cs50notes.pdf">CS50:</a> CS50 is Harvard College's Introduction to Computer Science course. It teaches students without prior
programming experience to think algorithmically and computationally by starting them off learning C, then moving onto Python and Javascript
for web development. It introduces data structures, algorithms, asymptotic analysis, and other concepts in theoretical computer science
in the process. Highly recommend.
</li>

<li><a href="/static/anotes/cs50Wnotes.pdf">CS50 Web Programming:</a>  CS50 became so popular that professor David J. Malan,
decided to spin off other versions on EdX to teach a wider audience about a variety of topics. This one is a course, similar in scope and rigour to
CS50, but focusing entirely on web programming. It goes through back-end with Flask and Django, Front-end with Javascript, production life
cycles, devOps and deployment, scalability, security, and teaches you to think like a software engineer as well as to write code. </li>

<li><a href="/static/anotes/climate notes.pdf">Energy and Climate: </a>  These are notes on various articles and videos I've consumed. I'm yet to update
them with my notes on the books I'm reading, and so they are incomplete, but they might still be helpful as an introduction
to the energy and climate landscape.
</li>

<li><a href="/static/anotes/disruptnotes.pdf">TechCrunch Disrupt 2019 Review & Summary:</a> Disrupt SF is allegedly the biggest startup conference on
the planet. I'm inclined to believe that. Disrupt was great; I learned a lot, met some
very smart people who are changing the world, and many other smart people who are not. This doc contains detailed notes on
the conference and its proceedings, as well as my opinions. </li>

<li><a href="/static/anotes/valleynotes.pdf">What Makes Silicon Valley So Great?</a>  This was a question I wanted answered when I moved over here,
  because I actually want(ed) to spend my life outside the United States--mainly in Europe and Asia. And so you can imagine
  I was hopeful that tech and startup ecosystems outside the San Franscisco Bay Area were comparably robust. But I was disappointed to
  discover that "Silicon Valley" is enormously, indescribably, ahead of any other region on Earth. This document explains why.
</li>

<li><a href="/static/anotes/Chemistry Pre-U Notes.pdf">Advanced High School & Early Undergraduate Chemistry:</a>  These are notes for Pre-U Chemistry, a
  British high school curriculum for advanced students. They will cover a lot of first, and even touch on second, year content
  from an undergraduate chemistry degree stateside. Contains everything from molecular orbital theory to acid-base calculations, and more.
</li>

<li><a href="/static/anotes/Physics Pre-U Exam Notes.pdf">Advanced High School & Early Undergraduate Physics:</a>  These are notes for Pre-U Physics, a
  British high school curriculum for advanced students. They will cover a lot of first, and even touch on second, year content
  from an undergraduate physics degree stateside. Covers everything from derivations of the Bohr model of the atom to
differential equations used to describe simple harmonic motion, and more.
</li>

<li><a href="/static/anotes/fCC Notes.pdf">Basic Front-End Software Engineering:</a>  These are the notes I took
  going through FreeCodeCamp, a website that teaches you front-end web development from 0 coding experience. While the CS50
  series focused on logic & back-end this course teaches you
  the syntax you need to know to create user interfaces and front ends, via HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and their respective frameworks, like Bootstrap and React.
  It also emphasizes implementation of basic
  data structures and algorithms, a contrast to CS50's more theoretical approach.
</li>

<li><a href="/static/anotes/websummitnotes.pdf">Web Summit Notes:</a>  Web Summit in Lisbon, Portugal,
attracts over 80,000 people from around the world, and is allegedly the biggest tech conference on Earth.
I thought Portugal was magical, and had an enormous amount of fun in the one week I was there. Lisbon itself
was a stunning city taken right out of a fairy tale. But I didn't
think the conference itself was that valuable--it was watered down and tailored towards a non-technical audience.
</li>

<li><a href="/static/anotes/edtechnotes.pdf">Edtech Notes:</a>  These notes are based on two books I've read
  about education and education technology, and they outline both why the American public education system
  is broken, and what we can do about it. Similar to my energy/climate notes, except based on actual academic
  texts as opposed to online research.
