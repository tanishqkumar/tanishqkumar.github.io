<h3>Academic Learning & Notes</h3>
<p class="notop">
When learning something new, I'll never take notes. The first time I'm exposed to new content,
the emphasis is always on digesting and internalising the material; whether that's a lecture on pointers and threading (CS),
special relativity (physics), or romantic motifs in Pride & Prejudice (english). On the second pass through the material, though,
I'll paraphrase the contents of the lecture, YouTube video or textbook I'm learning from into a pages document. And then
on the third pass, my goal is to shorten my own notes. Each pass of paraphrasing demands I "explain" the material in a new, more concise
manner (see <a href="https://mattyford.com/blog/2014/1/23/the-feynman-technique-model">the Feynman Technique.</a>)
 It also produces clean, palatable notes for my own future reference. I've taken notes on a variety of things throughout my life,
 and some people I've shared them with have found them useful, and you may too. They're given below, in no particular order.

  <li><a href="/notes">International Biology Olympiad:</a> These are notes that summarise 1) A-level Biology (a more rigorous and in-depth
    version of AP Biology, for my American friends) and 2) offer loads of information dumps that are highly relevant to those preparing
  for Olypmiad Biology competitions, since much of these notes came from past IBO problems I couldn't do, or from important parts of
Campbell Biology (a staple undergraduate Biology textbook).</li>
