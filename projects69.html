<p class="notop">If there was one thing I took away from my teenage gap year in the Bay Area,
    it was action bias and the importance of always building something on the side. It's the only way to tell whether someone is 
    all talk or not. Downloads, revenue and citations don't lie even if people might. Here's some stuff I've built recently. 
    The brackets denote how long it took (order of magnitude) to build. So (H) demarcates 
    a few hours spent coding, and likewise with (D) as days, (W) as weeks, and (M) as months.</p>
    
<h3>Software</h3>
<ul>
  <li><a  href="www.covidgapyears.com">CovidGapYears. </a></li> (W) Social network for gap year students built right as COVID hit and 
    gap years started to become normal. First line of code to 10,000 active users and $3000 monthly revenue in 5 weeks, then acquired 
    by the Gap Year Association. Built with Django, Postgres and vanilla Javascript. Had some interesting algorithmic matching problems 
    on the backend, connecting students considering gap years to those who had taken them based on information extracted from 
    user profiles. <br><br>
    

<li>MMORPG Trading Bots.</li> (W) Used statistical ideas to flip virtual commodities in a very popular online game, 
expanded to 1000+ such bots running in parallel on AWS. Technical challenges (aside from the quanty finance stuff) 
included building chatbots to 
mimic real human behavior to avoid bans, a networking engine to mule (virtual) money, and a variety of other cool stuff. 
Though I omit the name of the game and exact methods used for obvious reasons, it suffices to 
say that this helped me pay for college. <br><br>

  <li>Tic Tac Toe RL.</li> (H) Used tabular and then fitted Q-learning to have a program play a few million games of NxN tic tac toe 
  against itself overnight, and then play my little siblings and I in the following morning. Decent for small N, but 
  curse of dimensionality too stronk for larger N. <br><br>

  <li>IOI, ICPC, CodeForces Solutions.</li> (W) I maintain a small compendium of solved competitive programming problems
  with reasonably efficient implementations in C++. <br><br>

  <li>DocRex.</li> (D) Web-based text editor that understands the thrust of your writing, and recommends (in real time) articles and blogs 
  that have similar and/or opposing views to that which you write. Work in progress, mainly reduces to a bunch of 
  NLP trickery. <br><br>

  <li>Synci.</li> (W) Low-latency state synchronization library built for distributed systems, from the ground up. 
    Entirely open source, built as quick and diry infra for startups trying to scale, since big companies build custom infra 
    for their use cases and and have no incentive to open source it. 
   <br><br>

  <li>Game Development, iOS and Desktop.</li> (M) Built a variety of mobile and desktop based games, including X and Y. 
  Over 12,000 downloads across all of them, having generated a measly $200 in revenue overall. <br><br>
</ul>

<h3>Hardware</h3>
<br>
TBD. Would like to try build an internal combustion engine from scratch in Spring 2021, 
as well as work on a construction site in Summer 2021. 
<br><br>

<h3>Research</h3>
<br>
TBD. Aiming to do a lot more statistics, algorithms, and economics research over the next year, full-time. 
<br><br>

<h3>Writing</h3>
<ul>
    <li>This site.</li> (M) Though I keep this more as a medium for dialogue over time with myself 
    and as a tool aiding my own thought, people find and share this site against my best wishes. 
    Over 10,000 people have read essays I have written.
