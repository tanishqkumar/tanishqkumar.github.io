<h3>Gap Year Goals</h3>
<p>
Here I outline some of the high level goals I have for this gap year, ones that I'm on track and
hope to hit. Ambitious, but realistic--just <i>barely</i> achievable. They are listed in descending order of priority.
</p>

<ul>
  <li> <strong>Software Engineering: </strong>Have 5 fully-fledged web apps as projects to showcase full-stack proficiency,
  incorporating React, Django, and having worked with other frameworks, like Flask and Node.
  Understand all industry lingo reasonably well even if you haven't used it yourself, from Kubernetes/Docker to
  MongoDB and Firebase. Have 5 fully-fledged mobile apps built with React Native that encompass a range of
  functionalities, so that I'm confident I can prototype any industrial idea I have. Know which CS courses I'd
  like to take at Harvard, and why. Have built 5 smaller weekend-size projects, from chrome extensions to CLI workflow tools.
 </li>
    <li> <strong>Industry Thinking: </strong>Have thought about problem spaces in 4 different industries. Have strong
      opinions on the viability of working as a tech entrepreneur in
      each industry informed by reading, sure, but also online research, as well as talking to selected experts.
      Have 1-2 industries, and a few problems in those industries, that I'm not only very informed about, but am also
      ideating solutions for. Know which problems are the most profitable, why they haven't been worked on,
      and otherwise, the problems most important for human progress.
     </li>
    <li> <strong>Valley Thinking: </strong>Have notes on 50+ meetings with Bay Area-specific people. Have attended 25+ events on entrepreneurship
      --conferences, meetups, etc.--in the area, and got a deep, vocational knowledge of
  the exact steps involved in starting and scaling an early stage company, from investors and founders alike. Understand
why Silicon Valley is the world's tech hub, and the reasons for moving over here to start a company.  </li>
<li> <strong>Great People: </strong> Have read 10 biographies on some of the most influential people in human history--from Aristotle to Einstein, da Vinci to Shakespeare--
  and understood 2-3 themes to consciously take action on. Be able to synthesize insights in conversation
  across these topics, and embed their shared traits into my daily life, and track results.
 </li>
 <li> <strong>French: </strong>Having lived in Paris, understood it as a city, cultural and intellectual center, I speak french fluently to the extent that you can have a seamless conversation with anyone from a Taxi driver
 to a friend at a coffee shop. It doesn't need to be tight enough to debate philosophy, but certainly robust enough that natives cannot
tell that you're clearly a foreigner and are happy to talk only in french--much like my Hindi.  </li>
    <li> <strong>Breakdancing: </strong>Have a beautiful toprock and groove down, where there are 10+ moves seamlessly
    blended together and non-repeated every time I perform, and I can perform without a problem
     to songs I've never heard before just based on intuition. I have 6+ footwork moves down solid, as well as their transitions
   looking stunning. I've mastered windmills and swipes, and incorporate those to kill the beat. I've performed multiple times
 at parties, clubs, and even bboy battles, enjoying it every time.  </li>
     <li> <strong>Pick-Up: </strong>Cold approach is instinctive at this point, both daygame and at social events,
       with 50+ cold/lukewarm approaches behind me, each, and extensively documented experience on attraction/escalation, as well
       as physical experience hovering around 10L. Tension is fun at this point, and non-neediness is palpable
       purely because of experience at this point. Understood the value of casual things VS more involved relationships,
       and developed a personal philosophy of my value system, in women and relationships both.
        Mastered storytelling and studied humour in a platonic context,
       having implemented both consciously in several instances, with notes and iteration.
      </li>
     <li> <strong>Writing: </strong>20+ long pieces on web-site, analysed 20+ pieces of great work and implemented several changes
       as a result of seeing good writing. Gotten feedback on a few from those great writers, or otherwise--and iterated accordingly. Larger
       vocabulary, more elegant thinking, marginally less purple prose and more, refined mature style. Compare my final works to those of the
       writers I'm examining until they are just as good, if not better, in blind tests with intelligent friends.
      </li>
     <li> <strong>Miscellaneous: </strong>Learning and mastering the fundamentals of formal/ballroom dance--tango, waltz, foxtrot, and more.
       Have learned how to sail, can spend times at sea alone and
   safely, and work and think productively while doing so. Have attended a 10-day meditation retreat, ruminated over the future of humanity and my own personal philosophy, and have an opinion on
 the power of meditation (or lack thereof). Have reviewed and studied proofs and problem solving to prepare myself for advanced college-level mathematics. </li>
