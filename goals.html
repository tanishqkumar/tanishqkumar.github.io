<h3>Gap Year Goals</h3>
<p>
Here I outline some of the high level goals I have for this gap year, ones that I'm on track and
hope to hit. Ambitious, but realistic--just <i>barely</i> achievable.
</p>

<ul>
  <li> <strong>Software Engineering: </strong>Have 5 fully-fledged web apps as projects to showcase full-stack proficiency,
  incorporating React, Django, and knowing the ins and outs of other frameworks, like Flask, Node, as well
  as devOps via Heroku. Understand all industry lingo well, from Kubernetes/Docker to
  MongoDB. Have completed 200+ problems on LeetCode and have mastery over use cases and
  implementation of algorithms/data structures, as well as have extensive experience with systems
  design questions via practise interview and complex projects. Similarly, have 5 fully-fledged
  mobile apps, some created with React Native and some built in Swift/Java, that encompass a range of
  functionalities, so that I'm confident I can prototype any industrial idea I have. Know which CS courses I'd
  like to take at Harvard.
 </li>
    <li> <strong>Industry Reading: </strong>Have read, analysed, taken notes on, 48 books from 6 different industries. Have strong
      opinions on the viability of working as a tech entrepreneur in
      each industry informed by reading, online research, as well as talking to selected experts.
      Have 1-2 industries, and a few problems in those industries, that I'm not only very informed about, but am also
      ideating solutions for, and am convinced they are profitable as well as world-changing.
     </li>
    <li> <strong>Valley Thinking: </strong>Have notes on 50+ meetings with Bay Area-specific people, including >10 prominent
    VCs/angels. Have attended 10+ events on entrepreneurship in the area, and got a deep, vocational knowledge of
  the exact steps involved in starting and scaling an early stage company, from investors and founders alike. Understand
why Silicon Valley is the world's tech hub, and the reasons for moving over here to start a company.  </li>
    <li> <strong>Breakdancing: </strong>Have a beautiful toprock and groove down, where there are 10+ moves seamlessly
    blended together and non-repeated every time I perform, and I can perform without a problem
     to songs I've never heard before just based on intuition. I have 6+ footwork moves down solid, as well as their transitions
   looking stunning. I've mastered windmills and swipes, and incorporate those to kill the beat. I've performed several times
 at parties and clubs, enjoying it every time. After Jan/Feb, focus on weight training so I end year at around 65kg, 10%.  </li>
    <li> <strong>BCEF: </strong>Have won a $250,000+ full ride merit-scholarship to Harvard. </li>
    <li> <strong>CareerFear Award Applications: </strong>Have been featured on further international media,
      perhaps <i>The Guardian</i> or <i>BBC</i>, for op-eds on
    careers thinking, counselling, adolescence, and change-making. This coupled with further international awards
  such as the Global Changemakers and Diana Award, and the networks/communities that come with those. </li>
    <li> <strong>Language: </strong>Have spent a month in Paris, now I speak French fluently, satisfy the Harvard
    language requirement, and my Hindi has been polished enough at home to honestly say I speak
  that fluently as well.  </li>
    <li> <strong>Pick-Up: </strong>Cold approach is instinctive at this point, both daygame and at social events,
      with 100+ approaches behind me and extensively documented experience on attraction/escalation, as well
      as physical experience at an IO level or beyond. Tension is fun at this point, and non-neediness is palpable
      purely because of experience at this point. Asymptotically approaching Bond. Mastered storytelling, and have decoded good-boy alpha and
      implemented changes to couple Bond with a happy personality to effectively become Hubs.
     </li>
    <li> <strong>Writing: </strong>10+ long pieces on web-site, anlaysed all of Yehong's work and implemented several changes
      as a result of seeing good writing. Gotten feedback on a few--from her, or otherwise--and iterated accordingly. Larger
      vocabulary, more elegant thinking, marginally less purple prose. Objectively compare my final works to hers until they are
      just as good, if not better, having internalised all the good writing techniques by this point, which is reflected
      in anything and everything I write.
     </li>
