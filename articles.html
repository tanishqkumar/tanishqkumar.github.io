        I think essays are a much underutilised form of communication. Most
        people I know submit that they haven't written an essay since college
        or, in the case of some more technical folk, high school. I think that a
        good essay is long enough to capture the majority of the thrust of a
        book in a small fraction of its length, yet short enough to force the author to
        make one clear point, since it teases apart the veil of length many authors 
        use to hide behind. <br /><br />
        In fact, much of the reason I'm interested in learning to write well at
        all is because I want to perfect the art of the essay: to be
        able to make bold claims incisively, yet with flair. <br /><br />
        Here, I pick apart some of the most compelling or controversial pieces
        I've been sent or stumbled across, summarizing them whilst injecting my
        own views. Broadly, they're centred around technology, innovation,
        economics, the future, and how we're getting there. I concede that the
        sources are uniformly biased towards Silicon Valley at the moment, but I
        hope to broaden the scope of my analyses to other geographies and
        domains with time. As always,

<button class="accordion"><h3>Dan Wang</h3></button>

    <ul>
        <li>Definite Optimism as Human Capital</li>
        Wonderful piece, excellently written. Centrally contends that American
        shift from a manufacturing to service economy has real implications for
        its technological future. Wang thinks having a clear
        vision for the future (not necessarily a rosy one) is in itself a type
        of human capital, like intelligence, and sees popular understanding of
        manufacturing and industry an important part of that. He ultimately calls
        for more investment in sci-fi that paints more optimistic pictures of
        technology in the future. Some novel points and a fascinating thesis,
        but I don't think its call-to-actions are realistic or indeed very
        concrete.
        <br /><br />
        <li>Why Do So Few People Major in Computer Science?</li>
        Given the rise of the tech industry in popular culture, and the associated increase 
        in students pursuing STEM degrees, why is there not an outsized or even large bump in 
        people studying CS over the last few decades? He swats away specious arguments like 
        it being "too hard", students choosing majors based on employability, and 
        immigrants taking jobs. I wasn't left with a single compelling answer to the initial question, 
        but personally, I think it's mostly insular "hacker culture" (where programmers 
        seem almost to be a cult of nerds) and people's lack of exposure to 
        programming and CS in high school, which means many simply don't seriously consider it in college.
        <br /><br>

        <li>College as an Incubator for Girardian Terror</li>
        I submit that I don't know much about Girard beyond his theory of mimetic desire.
        The tendency towards mimetic desire, he argues, is 
        most prevalent when people are similar in their outlooks and goals. And nowhere, Wang says, is a there a more
        carefully cultivated homogeny than on American college campuses, where students are hand-picked 
        based on the twin sieves of competitiveness and ability to game the system.
        Wang suggests the solution, for a given college student, is to be either intensely mimetic (win at the social chess
        from the inside) or not mimetic at all. 
        <br /><br>

        <li>Peter Thiel and Thinking For Yourself</li>
        Makes a very interesting point that the uniformity of career paths of elite college grads serves as 
        empirical proof that colleges do not teach critical, independent thinking. There's also other evidence that 
        most college students are not significantly better at forming arguments and reasoning critically when they graduate 
        compared to when they start, but that's another issue. This essay mainly about innovation in Europe, and 
        how, for example, German culture promotes independent thinking, yet Europe produces so few unicorns. Wang suggests 
        this comes down to policy and cultural emphasis on stability and community. I agree, with firsthand experience 
        showing how ambition and individuality are subtly but actively looked down upon in European culture. Status in Europe is 
        divorced from work and money much moreso than in the states.

      <ul>
          <li>Mukesh Ambani Won the World’s Most Expensive Sibling Rivalry</li>
          Reliance, the company founded by the Ambanis, is to India what Dow Chemical, AT&T, 
          Exxon Mobil, and Amazon would be to the US if they were a single conglomerate.
          Dhirubhai's long-term insight that yarn was a growing consumer niche came in very handy 
          as he started a company around it and timed it perfectly. Dhirubhai kept an office building stuffed 
          with employees whose sole purpose was to offer company-funded scholarships to government officials' 
          kids. Isn't that crazy? Makes you see that success in Indian markets comes down to who is better at navigating 
          a complex and deeply social regulatory environment, with Mukesh taking the stance of always 
          posturing to line up with important policies, and getting to know officials before they rise to power.
          I'm also very intriuged by high-society in Mumbai; it seems like a fascinating counterpoint to 
          Hollywood and Wall Street.

<button class="accordion"><h3>Paul Graham</h3></button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>
<ul>
        <li>The Lesson to Unlearn</li>
        Our education system is centered around preparing for tests. In other
        words, learning to game the system. Graham believes startups are good
        because incentives are aligned: you only win if you make a great product
        that users want. I argue that the "greatness" of a product is never so
        binary: often “gaming the system” plays a crucial part in getting
        funding or distribution that characterizes the line separating scale
        adoption to fizzling out. Still, startup incentives are aligned better
        than most jobs and industries. It's fascinating that people so
        ubiquitously believe that gaming the system is associated with real work
        because that’s how you advanced in the metric-black-hole-riddled 20th
        century oligopolic society.<br /><br />

        <li>The Bus Ticket Theory of Genius</li>
        He believes that the capacity to undergo failure at a rate needed to
        produce great work is not a product of infinite diligence, but infinite
        curiosity. Genius is merely “aimless, but obsessive, curiosity about
        things that happen to end up mattering”.<br /><br />

        <li>The Refragmentation</li>
        The dvided American state is the natural state of things, not a novel
        world order. The 20th century US was one unusually held together by the
        twin threads of war and oligopoly. War led to the rise of big business
        (government contracts and legislative support), and technology was its
        downfall (eg by making supply chains feasibly efficient, so people
        benefitted from pros of modularity but not cons of miscommunication).
        Graham sees economic inequality (even increasing amounts of it) an
        inevitable consequence (and indeed, the natural state of things in a
        free market) of technological development (leverage increases over time
        as technology matures—the same amount of innovation in 1800 generated
        less value than it does with computers today, and thus made less
        millionaires).
        <br /><br />

        <li>Do Things That Don’t Scale</li>
        A classic piece that has become part of Valley lore. Making a startup
        succeed is in fact less about focusing on a problem and more about being
        fiercely attached to a general problem space, as well as aggressive user
        acquisition. Writing code in your room and feeling great about wrangling
        technical challenges is easier, more measurable and satisfying than
        getting rejected by strangers and asking yourself tough, honest
        questions. So don’t fall into that trap. Airbnb went door to door in NYC
        recruiting users. And this initial fragility is not unique to them.
        Going out of your way to delight customers (eg hand-written thank-you
        notes) doesn’t scale, but it helps you scale as word of mouth matters,
        and experience is part of product. The product/company test is a vector:
        it's not just the technology at any given moment, but sales/user
        acquisition/experience is something you can and must be creative about.
        It’s the yang to the R&D ying that pulls in funding. It’s part of the
        test that is starting a company.
        <br /><br />

        <li>How to do What You Love</li>
        Prestige is especially powerful as a magnet when you’re young—it causes
        you not to work on what you like, but what you’d like to like. You have
        to enjoy both the end (philosophically) and the process (most of the
        nitty-gritty)—how can this be reconciled with Cal Newport’s idea of
        being able to love doing anything, like a craftsman? Parents are
        conservative because they share all the risk of your actions, but none
        of the reward. Be careful about sticking to goalposts you determined a
        long time ago, lest you have a life chosen for you by a high school
        kid.<br /><br />

        <li>A Student’s Guide to Startups</li>
        Undergrads will find it difficult to succeed with a startup because they
        have a back-up plan: being a student. The paradigm and incentive
        structure that class projects promote (all work contributes to grade,
        work harder you’ll do better, there’s an unambiguous mark scheme and
        someone who knows all the answers) the wrong attitude about how you
        solve problems in real life. A startup spends many months building stuff
        to throw away. Someone with “work experience” takes responsibility for
        their life and knows the reward is not Ferraris, but the ability to stop
        treading the employment wheel. And people with this experience know that
        you’re rewarded for building things people want, not for working
        hard.<br /><br />

        <li>What You’ll Wish You’d Have Known</li>
        If sixteen year old Einstein or Shakespeare was in class with you, you’d
        never know they were bound for greatness, but that they were just
        another impressive teenager. When stuck choosing between two options,
        choose the one that preserves optionality, which is usually the harder
        one (math vs economics). Work hard on bleeding-edge projects related to
        your interests, and be the type of person where ideas can constantly and
        easily take roost, then act on these questions out of curiosity, not out
        of a desire to “make this your life’s work”<br /><br />

        <li>How to Make Wealth</li>
        The piece that changed the way I think about startups, and made me a lot
        less critical about entrepreneurs and Silicon Valley. Founding a startup
        is merely compressing the stress of decades of work into a few years,
        hoping to reap commensurate rewards. Graham claims that a smart hacker
        working at a small startup will create between 10-100x more output than
        the same hacker at a large company if they work much harder and are not
        constrained by corporate bullshit. The problem with large companies is
        that incentives are misaligned. Your value-add to the company can’t be
        judged individually, so instead it’s just averaged across all employees.
        This is a good deal for most people, but the top 5% get screwed, since
        they produce most of the value and get paid about the same as everyone
        else. Smallness gives measurability, and leverage comes from building
        technology: coming from the word technique, the way things are done.

  <p>

      <ul>
        <li>The Most Intolerant Wins: The Dictatorship of the Small Minority</li>
        I've heard mixed reviews about Taleb, some friends touting his genius, academics branding his work 
        as intellectual fast food. This article is about how complex systems exhibit emergent behavior,
         and about how a small, stubborn minority can get their way if the 
        corresponding majority is flexible. A subtle and important statistical fact, but not wildly profound. 
        I'm wary because, like Gladwell, Taleb uses copious amounts of anecdotes to make points about
        statistical concepts. Credit where it's due, though: his examples are compelling and are drawn from 
        domains as varied as religion and language to dietary laws and pop culture. And his conclusion is novel: 
        that for a society's ethical code to move forward, it need only be championed by a virtuous minority (3-4%).
        As much as many people hate blind SJWs, intolerance, he argues, really is the only approppriate 
        response to intolerance, and social media is making it easier than ever before to become part of 
        this virtuous minority of moral movers-and-shakers.

<button class="accordion"><h3>Tech Review</h3></button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>
      <ul>
          <li>How Technology is Destroying Jobs</li>
          Starting in the 2000s, productivity was "decoupled" from jobs in a way we've never seen before. 
          The science, technology and automation that enables huge increases in productivity is created by a small 
          number of highly educated technologists who reap rewards. 
          Despite enormous national productivity gains in recent decades, the median worker is no better off. In fact, they may be 
          out of a job. In a Marxist world, this is the endgame: to have technology be such a huge lever that a tiny fraction 
          of the population can sustain life, while the others enjoy the fruits of advanced civilisation.
          But in the free markets that 
          have brought us so far, the lengthening of the technological lever simply means economic inequality will 
          continue to widen, with no clear end in sight. This isn't doomsday, though. As certain jobs are obviated, 
          other service jobs related to that obviation will pop up, they will just probably be higher skill than the 
          original jobs.
          Jobs on both ends of the skill spectrum, like waiting tables and software engineering, will balloon,
          while repetitive office jobs in the middle, occupied by secretaries and accountants, will be gone.

<button class="accordion"><h3>Andy Matuschak</h3></button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>
      <ul>
          <li>Why Books Don't Work</li>
          Starts with the problem statement: books are media based on a faulty assumption
           that merely by reading lines on a page does a reader 
          understand the material. Understanding material 
          involves a lot of metacognition: 
        knowing what is important and why, navigating common misconceptions, comparing perspectives, 
        solving problems, and more. 
        We've known for a long time 
        that the bulk of learning happens in metacognition, 
        yet books force the reader to bear this large burden of planning and structuring their learning 
        all on their own. What if the tasks of 
        reading and understanding weren't two separate things? Matuschak 
        champions the idea of a new medium that 
        shoulders this metacognitive burden for the reader.

      <ul>
        <li>Self-Deception as The Root of Political Failure</li>
        I'm very interested in the limitations of democracy, and I often wonder whether it's the 
        the terminal system of governance, partly because I think there are scenarios where 
        a strong, even authoratarian government, can be useful (c. Chinese industriliazation in mid 20th century). 
        While behavioral economists put forth the idea that individuals often act against their best interest 
        out of psychological bias, Cowen, here, instead says that poor political decisions by the voter are a 
        consequence of individuals acting FOR their best interest. This is because their goal when voting is not in 
        coming to a superior political outcome, but instead in expressing and reaffirming their identity through their vote.
        He believes that individuals falling victim to confirmation bias is inevitable given our biology, that  
        "identity politics" is not some new, problematic status quo plaguing the 21st century. 
        It is how humans have, and always will, act in democratic systems. Also fascinating to learn that self-deception 
        and delusion may actually be evolutionarily <i>advantageous</i> as they give you more conviction in your actions 
        and more confidence in your identity.

<div class="panel">
  <p>
<ul>
        <li>What Happened To Innovation?</li>
        I chuckled hearing this in the voice of SamA, who got rich building a
        location-based social media app. He defines major innovations as those
        that make you think back and say “I can’t even remember life without
        this” in the same way that I do with smartphones, even though I was
        around when my Mom had a flip phone. In 1990, only 2.5M people had
        access to the internet, and that’s since grown 2000x in 30 years. Same
        with smartphones. But despite the Apollo mission having the
        computational power of a modern toothbrush, we haven’t seen any major
        advances in the physical world of similar magnitude (aerospace, energy,
        biotech).
        <br /><br />
        <li>Premature Optimization</li>
        Startups often wrongly focus on incremental optimization that will, at
        best, lead to a 2-3x growth (email campaigns, A/B testing) when they
        need a 100x growth to survive. Focus on making shit people want, then
        optimize incrementally as you grow into the market.

        <li>You and Your Research, by Richard Hamming</li>
        Long talk given by a mathematician/computer scientist who did important
        work in coding theory, and worked closely with the likes of Feynman and
        Shannon. Outlines his thesis on what comprises a "first-class
        scientist". Though Altman cites it as influential, I honestly did glean
        much more than a handful of empty platitudes. Hamming mentions that
        there is certainly a component of luck associated with what exactly you
        accomplish, but none involved in determining whether you accomplish
        anything at all.
