I think it's important to have idols. Let's be clear--not to idolize people, but to have a set of people
who you deeply admire for one reason or the other; real or fictional. I've found that having a set of people I
respect and aspire to be like helps me make the right decisions on a day-to-day basis--if I don't think my idols
would make a certain decision, neither do I. <br><br>
You can't work towards your ideal future reality if you don't even know
what the reality looks like--having concrete examples of role models who you want to mould certain aspects of your life around
helps with that. I'm generally sceptical of "inspirational quotes" but I've also included quotes, by those who I look up to, and otherwise,
that have resonated over the years or reconsider my position on something.

<h3>Quotes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>“What you leave behind is not what is ingrained in stone monuments, but what is woven into the lives of others”</li>
    - Pericles<br><br>
  <li>“Beware the barrenness of a busy life” </li>
    - Socrates<br><br>
    <li>“When we are children we seldom think of the future. This innocence leaves us free to enjoy ourselves as few adults can. The day we fret about the future is the day we leave our childhood behind.”</li>
      - Kvothe<br><br>
  <li>“No man has the right to be an amateur in the matter of physical training. It is a shame for a man to grow old without seeing the beauty and strength of which his body is capable”</li>
    - Socrates<br><br>
  <li>“Life is not fair; get used to it.”</li>
    - Bill Gates<br><br>
  <li>“There's no talent here, this is hard work. This is an obsession. Talent does not exist, we are all equals as human beings. You could be anyone if you put in the time. You will reach the top, and that's that. I am not talented. I am obsessed.”</li>
    - Conor McGregor<br><br>
  <li>“When they chant 'Roger', I hear 'Novak'.”</li>
    - Novak Djokovic<br><br>
  <li>“Silence is one of the great arts of conversation.”</li>
    - Cicero<br><br>
  <li>“It is easier to find men who will volunteer to die, than to find those who are willing to endure pain with patience.”</li>
    - Caesar<br><br>
  <li>“Genius, Billionaire, Playboy, Philanthropist.”</li>
    - Tony Stark<br><br>
  <li>“I always enjoyed learning a new tongue.</li>
    - James Bond<br><br>
  <li>“I have stolen princesses back from sleeping barrow kings. I burned down the town of Trebon. I have spent the night with Felurian and left with both my sanity and my life. I was expelled from the University at a younger age than most people are allowed in. I tread paths by moonlight that others fear to speak of during day. I have talked to gods, loved women, and written songs that make the minstrels weep. You may have heard of me.”</li>
    - Kvothe<br>
