<h3>Time Log</h3>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Fall Semester:</strong> Gained a ton of mathematical maturity, get back into the groove of working hard, 
learned a large amount of linear algebra, probability, systems programming, and a good bit of microeconomics. All very applicable and 
useful stuff. Thrilled to have such stimulating courses and professors, and remote learning turned out to be a better academic experience
than in-person school, in my opinion. Still sucks that I don't get to interact with people my age, though. 
<br>
<br>
<strong>Winter Break:</strong> Shoring up my knowledge of vector calculus, algorithms and machine learning in preparation for 
what promises to be a tough (but rewarding) spring semester. Working full time as a software engineer to get a feel for 
what a career in tech might actually look like. Playing lots of golf to catch up on sunshine. Cherishing this burst of time with 
family which may never come again. 
<br>
<br>
<strong>Spring Semester</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Feb 6. </li> Nice day trip to Al Ain with family. Read about, and did some math HW on, limits and continuity. 
  Read about network flows, linear programming, simplex, and Ford-Fulkerson in CLRS, watched OCW lectures. Did some problems. 
  Went to sleep early. Total around 7h work. Bad. 
<br>
  <li>Feb 7. </li> Slept 12 hours last night -- too much. Finished LP chapter in CLRS, thought about duality. Read about 
  hashing: balls into bins, bloom filters, document resemblence. Did most of week 3 of OCW pre-work for 036. Almost finished math HW. 
  Total around 9h work. Mediocre. 
<br>
  <li>Feb 8. </li> Got an early start: finished 036 Week 3, submitted stat HW and math HW. Watched stat lecture on 
  ECDF and bias-variance trade-off and read notes. Read about document resemblance in hashing, and read set cover and 
  union find in CLRS as prep for class. Total around 11h work. OK.
