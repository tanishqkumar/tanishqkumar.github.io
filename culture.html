  <h3>A Real Life Nomad</h3>
  <p class="notop">I have been to school with sons of Guatemalan immigrants and Emirati oyster farmers, with the daughters of Indian cobblers and British royalty.
    Through a childhood spent relocating—not by choice—from Kentucky to New York to Ohio, then New Delhi to Abu Dhabi,
    then London and now San Francisco, my identity has been molded by communities where diversity and difference are seen as
    opportunities, not threats. I remember the people I’ve met by the stories they told around cackling campfires at dusk and
    the moments of excitement we shared on beaches at dawn, not by the skin they wore or the language they spoke.

    To me, diversity isn’t the amount of melanin in your skin, but the wealth of stories, hopes and dreams you can gather on a team. <p></p>When
    they hear about my cultural background, people call it confusing. Chaotic, even. <p></p>To me, it is balanced.<p></p>

  My parents are both doctors, and the nature of their jobs has had them move around the world. While I am a US citizen residing in San Francisco, CA, and am attending college in the United States, no picture of who I am would be complete without an explanation of my family’s nomadic lifestyle and my cultural identity.<p></p>

  Growing up in America, I watched my parents—then medical students—put in 100-hour weeks for years on end. I learned that if you want something, you better work your tail off to get it. I witnessed how bad things sometimes happen to good people, and came to understand that the world is unfair and that it’s up to us to fix that.<p></p>

  Then in Delhi, where I lived with my grandparents, I played chess with the local washerman’s son after school every day. Drinking chai every evening, I was spoilt by my loving grandfather, who taught me that ambition means nothing if you can’t add joy to others’ lives.<p></p>

  Then in Abu Dhabi, I learned to play golf, and that the world is often different from how we might imagine it to be. All my preconceptions and worries about moving to the Middle-East were stamped out by the kindness and hospitality of the local people.<p></p>

  Going to boarding school in London, I experienced a city that championed a culture of banter, where I learned to befriend CEOs and bus drivers in equal measure, waiters and academics alike. My time there laid the seams for a tapestry of memorable conversations, one that I hope to continue weaving into what I’ll someday look back on as the fabric of my life.<p></p>

  I’m in San Francisco now. It’s a little sunnier here, and I’m excited to see what’s next.<p></p>
