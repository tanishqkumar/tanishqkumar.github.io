  <h1>A Real Life Nomad</h1>
  <p class="notop">I have been to school with sons of Guatemalan immigrants and Emirati oyster farmers, with the daughters of Indian cobblers and British royalty. Through a nomadic childhood spent in Kentucky and New York and Ohio,
    then New Delhi and Abu Dhabi, then London and now San Francisco, my identity has been molded by communities where diversity and difference are seen as opportunities, not threats.
    I most remember the people I’ve met by the stories they told around cackling campfires at dusk and the moments of excitement we shared on beaches at dawn,
    not by the skin they wore or the language they spoke. To me, diversity isn’t the amount of melanin in your skin,
    but the wealth of stories, hopes and dreams you can gather on a team. <br><br>When
    they hear about my cultural background, people call it confusing. Chaotic, even. <br><br>To me, it is balanced.<br><br>

  My parents are both doctors, and the nature of their jobs has had them move around the world. While I am a US citizen planning on attending college in the United States, no picture of who I am would be complete without an explanation of my family’s nomadic lifestyle and my cultural identity.<br><br>

  Growing up in America, I watched my parents—then medical students—put in 100-hour weeks for years on end. I learned that if you want something, you better work your tail off to get it. I witnessed how bad things sometimes happen to good people, and came to understand that the world is unfair and that it’s up to us to fix that.<br><br>

  Then in Delhi, where I lived with my grandparents, I played chess with the local washerman’s son after school every day. Drinking chai every evening, I was spoilt by my loving grandfather, who taught me that ambition means nothing if you can’t add joy to others’ lives.<br><br>

  Then in Abu Dhabi, I learned to play golf, and that the world is often different from how we might imagine it to be. All my preconceptions and worries about moving to the Middle-East were stamped out by the kindness and hospitality of the local people.<br><br>

  Going to boarding school in London, I experienced a city that championed a culture of banter, where I learned to befriend CEOs and bus drivers in equal measure, waiters and academics alike. My time there laid the seams for a tapestry of memorable conversations, one that I hope to continue weaving into what I’ll someday look back on as the fabric of my life.<br><br>

  During the first half of my gap year in San Francisco, I attended startup pitch nights and VC networking mixers, I spent coffee-fuelled nights tapping away at keyboards with
  software engineers and debating the merits of programming frameworks in my spare time. I learned that "business development" isn't just for stupid people, and that it's often
  more important than the technical side of a company, and saw how depressingly lonely life can be if you don't
  actively forge meaningful relationships when moving to a new place outside of the warm collegiate structure.

  I'm in Paris now. The lifestyle is a little slower, the coffee a little darker. Everyday people have an eye for the artistic side of life,
  and you know you're entering the countryside when the soft undertone of Marlbono is no longer discernable. I'm polishing up my french, and thinking about how
  software can improve national defense.

  This fall, I start school in Boston. I'm excited to see what's next.
