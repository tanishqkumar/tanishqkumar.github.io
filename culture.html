        <h1>A Real Life Nomad</h1>
        <p class="notop">
          I have been to school with sons of Guatemalan immigrants and Emirati
          oyster farmers, with the daughters of Indian cobblers and British
          royalty. Through a nomadic childhood spent in Kentucky and New York
          and Ohio, then New Delhi and Abu Dhabi, then London and San
          Francisco, my identity has been molded by communities where diversity
          and difference are seen as opportunities, not threats. <br /><br />When they hear
          about my cultural background, people call it confusing. Chaotic, even.
          <br /><br />To me, it is balanced.<br /><br />

          My parents are both doctors, and the nature of their jobs has had them
          move around the world. While I am a US citizen planning on attending
          college in the United States, no picture of who I am would be complete
          without an explanation of my family’s nomadic lifestyle and my
          cultural identity.<br /><br />

          Growing up in America, I watched my parents—then medical students—put
          in 100-hour weeks for years on end. <br /><br />

          Then in Delhi, where I lived with my grandparents, I played chess with
          the local washerman’s son after school every day.<br /><br />

          Then in Abu Dhabi, I learned to play golf and curse with a smile on my face.<br /><br />

          Going to boarding school in London, I saw a city where tradition and history 
          met innovation and futurism, where humour actually had layers to it.
          <br /><br />

          During my gap year in San Francisco, I attended
          startup pitch nights and VC networking mixers, learning
          to breathe the rarified air that gives the world's tech industry
          life.<br /><br />

          I'm back in Abu Dhabi now, taking classes remotely. 
          The lifestyle is a little slower, and I'm
          spending my afternoons reading history and writing proofs.
          <br /><br />
