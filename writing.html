<i> This was an essay I wrote for a competition while in high school, and it eventually led me to speak at Westminster Abbey on the same topic. </i>

Thick, conspicuous black frames sat atop his nose, just about covering the bottom half of his bushy olive eyebrows. His temple hinted at acne. The rest of his face was smooth, yet coarse with fatigue. He wore a long sleeved t-shirt, though it was slightly too short to fully cover his pastel white arms. James was an average twenty eight year old guy. It was tiring, what he was doing — he’d spent the better part of the last three hours chipping away at a PowerPoint about the firm’s revenues and projected growth. But he was nearly finished. Afterwards, he would go to the pub and join his three closest friends for a pint while watching the Six Nations. A little smile flickered across his face as his fingers pressed ctrl+S for the last time. A deep sigh. A yawn. He closed his laptop, took another sip from the paper cup of hot chocolate on his right, and began packing away his papers. Sometimes, he didn’t understand why he was making these PowerPoints; they achieved nothing. He questioned what his role as a ‘Digital Growth Specialist’ even meant, or how his degree in Geography was helping him. It’s okay, though. He wasn’t paid to ask silly questions like that. And, as long as he got paid at the end of the month, all was good. He got up, slung his blue rucksack over his shoulders, and walked back to his studio, a few hundred meters away from the café he was working out of. It had been a long day. Thank god he could crack a cold one with the guys and relax. It’s not easy doing work on Sundays. That wasn’t his job. A soft, simmering yellow sun began to set, and sleepy clouds drifted above as evening set in. James went to the pub, had some fags, a few pints, and lots of laughs. The next day, he went to work as usual.<p></p>


The mirror was stained with his younger sister’s attempts at using make-up, but Joshua could still see himself fairly clearly. His mum told him he looked handsome in his new grey blazer. She had sown it for him herself; his family could never afford to buy something like that. His white shirt was spick and span. Tucked in and wrinkle free. Ready for his first day of Year 9. His chiselled features and stark brown-green hair juxtaposed his otherwise pale skin and fragile frame. Joshua felt butterflies gnawing away inside him. When he arrived at school, his classroom was brimming with the quintessentially awkward chit-chat that characterises the first day at a new school.<p></p>

A few months in, Joshua’s parents were told that Josh was one of the top students in the year, and that he should start to think about setting his sights at top unis. His Geography teacher, especially, noted him to be one of the brightest students she had seen in fourteen years of teaching. His parents weren’t particularly ambitious, they didn’t mind what he wanted to do, or to be — as long as he was content. But Joshua already knew where he was going. He took pride in being unapologetically ambitious — he would go down in history. A thousand years from now, they would study him in class. He didn’t quite know what exactly he’d end up doing, but he knew he’d be the greatest that ever did it. What Josh just couldn’t understand, though, was how his fellow classmates could be so placid in everything they did. So willing to accept mediocrity. He could never accept being average. He would never be average. He would go to Oxford, then work for the government. Maybe then he’d run for Prime Minister or something like that. He’d make a great Prime Minister.<p></p>

Patricio was on the night shift today. His slight belly pooch made tying up his apron rather difficult. Ever since his friends mocked him when he was young, Patricio was somewhat insecure about his weight — you’d never be able to tell, though. He put on his hairnet removing only a few strands of jet black hair in the process. He had a wide frame — chubby but built, a tad under six foot. Bright red double deckers whistled past outside, just hearing the icy wind stir outside made him shiver. The restaurant was packed tonight. Men in dark blue suits fresh from Canary Wharf were gossiping in the corner, salsa dripping from their mouths; a loud group of teenage boys, pants hanging unforgivably low, chattering around the table in the middle, sharing a large bowl of tacos. It wasn’t usually this busy on a Saturday night. A young couple approached the counter, he gave them the standard smile: ‘Welcome to Chipotlé, what can I get you today?’. Five minutes and two burritos later, the girl paid by card, giggling with her boyfriend at her ear, his hands tickling her playfully. Patricio picked up the broom, and went to the corner to clean up after some customers, smirking as he saw a student not too much younger than himself, struggling with his Physics homework on the screen of his laptop in the corner of the restaurant. Patricio couldn’t help but bounce a little bit, the soft Mexican music in the restaurant was electric. He felt warm inside. It continued to snow softly, late into the night. <p></p>

Páchá could not, for the life of him, figure it out. He had been stuck on the same damn trigonometry problem for three hours now. Study Mechanical Engineering at Université Centralé and you’ll be set for life, they said. Pfft. So much for that. The shadows danced across his table as the chandelier above swayed gently in front of the candle illuminating his room. It was a quiet night. Eerily so, in fact. He heard dissonant sounds whispering in the distance. Sirens, rising. His mother burst into his room, breaking the door off one of its hinges, screaming. Her cheeks were wet with angst and eyes black with fear. <p></p>

<i>Páchá! Empaca tus cosas, tu padre dice que nos estamos yendo ahora, el conductor está esperando afuera, por favor, date prisa o vamos a morir malditamente. Cristo sálvanos!</i><p></p>

<i>[Páchá! Pack your stuff, your father says we're leaving right now, the driver is waiting outside, please, hurry or we're all going to die! Christ help us!]</i><p></p>

He did what she said. Stunned, Páchá grabbed his laptop, threw some clothes into a small suitcase and leapt over what remained of the door, jumping down the stairs four at a time. As he ran into the car, it began accelerating before he could close the door. A little time later, he sat in the back left seat of the car, his mother convulsing, sobbing, in his arms. He still didn’t know what was going on, where they were going, or why they were leaving everything behind. Increasingly, he felt as if he wouldn’t want to find out. His father sat in front, stoic as always, looking straight ahead. But he could see the red in his fathers eyes, and the dried tears lacing his nose. Through the rearview mirror, he saw fire, blazing in the distance behind them.

She moaned, stretched her hands out high, and let them drop, plopping softly onto her duvet with a light thud. Her alarm urged her to leave her kingdom of comfort and get ready for another day of work. Slipping into her fluffy velvet slippers, Hillary made her way to her toilet, a couple of metres away, flicked the soft yellow light on, and looked at herself blankly. Eyes flickering sheepishly, her hair was a mess and her oversized pyjama top about to fall off. All was good after a warm shower. Thank god the hot water had worked. She dried, combed, and did her hair, padded chocolate brown foundation onto her dark skin, leaned close to the mirror to make sure to get all the blemishes, and threw on her freshest pair of bright violet scrubs. On the way to the operation theatre, she took phone calls, as well as some caffeine pills. As always, Hillary had made sure to do her reading on the operation she was scheduled to do today. That said, the day’s operation was to be a fairly routine one: a standard gastric bypass. In Harlesden, she had made a name for herself. All sorts of people — addicts, office workers, the homeless and senior citizens alike came to her for major medical procedures. It made no difference to her, though — the laws of human anatomy worked the same for all of them. Two and a half hours later, she was in the middle of the bypass on a teenage girl who was incredibly overweight. Under the watchful eye of a sterile blue lamp she grit her teeth in silence, frustrated at her inability to tie up a stitch. Hillary continued fingering her way around the girl’s stomach, eventually tying the operation up cleanly. She was satisfied, and stared at her work for a few seconds, admiring the symmetry and raw beauty of the workings of the human body. Her nurse snapped her out of it, thrusting some documents to be filled out in front of her. That was all for the day. After a short drive home, Hillary stripped off her scrubs, damp socks, let loose her hair, unclasped her bra and dipped into the same set of comfy pyjamas she had woken up in. A few minutes later, she was curled up with day-old Chinese take-out in hand, and the most recent episode of Britain’s Got Talent on her laptop in front of her.

She had always been a suspicious child; Harriet knew something was up when she started seeing less and less of her mama. Every night, her mother used to sit by her bed side, arm in hand, and tell her about her own childhood — stories of adventures, exploits from when her mother was a child being raised in rural Ghana, where the family had come from. Harriet couldn’t relate to any of it of course; she was surrounded by picket fence and green grass, not dead shrubs and barbed wire, but it sounded fantastical and magical anyway. Her mama stopped doing that a few weeks ago, though. But Harriet didn’t want to complain — she was a big girl now, a seven year old shouldn’t need her mama tucking her in every night. She was short, even for her age, and her French plat and bubbly gait did nothing to make her look any older. She came back from school one Wednesday evening bursting to tell papa about how well she did in her science quiz. She did very well, indeed. But just before she dug into her alphabet soup, papa asked her to come to the living room. For reasons she couldn’t explain, she felt anxious. She had never seen papa so serious. Maybe he didn’t have a good day at work. Armed with nothing but a violet Barbie school bag — violet had always been her favourite colour — and a fiery desire to find out what’s going on, she plonked herself down on an armchair far too big for her facing her mother and father, who sat on the sofa opposite her.
<p></p>

‘Harriet, honey, we’re going to tell you something that might make you a little sad.’ her father swallowed, struggling to keep his composure.
<p></p>

‘Ok.’ suggested Harriet, pupils wide, ripe with innocence.
<p></p>

‘Mama is going to go away for a while.’ papa said. He held mama’s arm in his hand, squeezing it reassuringly.
<p></p>

‘Where?’ asked little Harriet.
<p></p>

‘Far away, to a better place.’ mama whispered. Mama started crying; Harriet couldn’t understand why. It was making her very sad.
<p></p>

‘When will mama come back?’ Harriet asked, her lips twitching, about to burst into tears.
<p></p>
‘She won’t.’
<p></p>

Before I help you, the reader, make sense of this little experiment, I urge you to consider whether you know a James, or a Patricio, or a Hillary. I’m sure you do — perhaps a colleague you meet regularly at the pub, maybe the pleasant young man who serves you every Saturday at your local Chipotlé. Conceivably a surgeon who operated on you once, and to whom you are forever grateful.
<p></p>
Really, I implore you: think about these people you know so well.
<br><br>
James, the white-collar young man, went on to die at the age of 63 from liver failure. He lived a contented man who knew his place. Sometimes, his sister missed him. His parents didn’t mourn. They were dead too. Few came to his funeral, and fewer still ever remembered him after his time was up. An average man, through and through.
<br><br>
What you don’t realise, though, is that Joshua, the ambitious kid who told himself he would go down in history grew up to be James. They are, quite literally, the same person being described under different names. A visionary young boy, full of promise, tempered by the twin hammers of familial and societal pressures. It’s surreal to think that people we think we know so well could have been anything — or anyone — in the past, and we would never be able to tell. Joshua grew up, studied Geography at Oxford, and got a comfortable job at a marketing firm where he worked for the rest of his life. It’s ironic, almost.
<br><br>
Patricio, the enthusiastic latino waiter at Chipotlé, was not always who you think. Just five weeks earlier, he was Páchá, a second-year university student studying engineering at the most prestigious university in Venezuela. Then, he fled for his life, alongside his family, from the political turmoil that the country had been thrust into. Now, he has a place to study Physics at the University of Nottingham, and is working at a fast-food restaurant in central London to accrue some money to pay his university tuition. His Venezuelan qualifications aren’t recognised in the UK, and he is therefore being forced to start university again. He’s optimistic though; he hopes to get a doctorate in Computer Science, and contribute to the field of Machine Learning.
<br><br>
Hillary, the bariatric surgeon who works to make her community a better place, hated science as a child. She would never have become a doctor if her mother hadn’t died of Myeloid Leukemia, an exceedingly rare cancer of the bone marrow. Yes, Harriet grew up to become Hillary; they’re the same person being described under two different names. The death of her mother shook her, and broke her in the years that ensued. She swore to herself she wouldn’t let others ever feel the same way, and pursued Medicine to help those in her community in Harlesden, a deeply underprivileged area.
<br><br>
Is this a work of fiction? No. After meeting and getting to know the man who I’ve described under the pseudonyms of Patricio/Páchá while doing my Physics homework at a Chipotlé, I was disturbed by how little I knew about London, its people, and their stories. So, as I’ve explored London, from Southwark to Camden to Notting Hill and beyond, I’ve taken it upon myself to approach exactly seventeen people on the streets of London, asking them about their lives. Some told me to piss off, others were more than happy to share their stories, where they came from, how they got here, and what they want from London, and from life. James/Joshua is the father of someone I talked to at length; Hillary/Harriet is a woman I shared an hour’s train ride with. These three agreed to have their stories shared with you if I kept them anonymous. As such, none of the names are real. But their stories are perhaps a little too real. To Westminster pupils, and to myself: this is what the world looks like. These are real people, going through experiences that wouldn’t seem out of place in a work of fiction. And they are all around us.
<br><br>
I’m not writing this to comment on these peoples’ lives, but to use these stories are tools to guide us towards a better understanding of the world, and a better understanding of each other. We’re all threads; threads running across a tapestry of delicate stories that comprise the human narrative. We’ll never be able to appreciate the magnificent scale of the human race, but we can certainly come closer than we are now. And we can do that with each other, with those we see everyday. We go through life forming superficial, transient relationships. But we don’t have to. Just as you knew nothing about the past lives of James, of Patricio, of Hillary, you likely know even less about your colleagues, your friends, your family.
<br><br>
Thus, I ask you — I beg you — to find out a little more about the people you think you know. They might shock you. Spend an extra few minutes talking to the cashier at Tesco about how his children are doing, ask your teachers more questions than you think is fair, push to learn more about the circumstances from which your own parents were borne. Maybe even nudge the person sitting next to you on the tube tomorrow morning, and strike up a conversation.
<br><br>
No, actually, don’t do that last one. That’s just annoying.
