  <h1>On Writing</h1>
  <p class="notop">
I'm convinced that writing is an undervalued skill. I'm saddened that most people don't make a conscious effort to improve how they write.
It doesn't matter what you do for a living; whether you're a chemist or mechanic, surgeon or lawyer, writing teaches you to think. Good
writing conveys nuance, elegance, structure, beauty. Learning to master the art of crafting prose teaches you to master your own mind.
Less pretentiously put, I think that speaking, listening, and thinking well, are all consequences of learning to write well. This page documents
my attempts to better my own writing. Most of these pieces will be terrible; and that's okay.

<h3>Western Philosophy, Cultural Identity and Boobs: A Reflection on Pornography & its Place in Society</h3>
<p class="notop">
<i> This was an essay I wrote on a whim. I hadn't written about philosophy before, and one of my housemates bet me I couldn't write an essay containing the word "PornHub". This was the outcome. </i><br><br>

In 2016, the human race watched a grand total of 91,980,225,000 videos on PornHub. That’s 5,246 centuries worth of explicit content. We really, really, like sex. What more does this tell us, though? The rise of the adult industry deserves careful thought; studying it gives us meaningful insight into the relationships we have with one another, the role of gender in our society, and, ultimately, the primal nature of the human condition. In this short essay I will attempt to explore the unique place pornography has taken in modern society through a philosophical lens. Through an attempt to fuse the rigorously analytical style of a scientist with the discursive yet deeply penetrative mindset of a philosopher, I hope to gain intuition for why we interact with pornography (and each other) in the way that we do. It’s important to recognise that this piece of writing is not meant to be academic or completely impartial. While steeped in large amounts of research, this short essay will also, inevitably, be swayed by my own opinions.
<br><br>
Before tackling the more subtle questions about pornography, we must address why we struggle to resist watching so much of it. Friedrich Nietzsche, one of the greatest continental philosophers of all, would frame this argument in context of his dichotomy between reason and impulse. Nietzsche used the Greek gods Apollo and Dionysius as metaphors through which to explain many aspects of human behaviour. While Apollo was the god of reason, restraint and the rational, Dionysius was, crudely put, ‘the god of tits and wine’. Dionysius was the more notorious of the two: symbolic of the more irrational, lustful beast Nietzsche believed was inside all of us. This contrast was representative of the battle he thought to be perennially raging on inside every human being: each decision being a choice between logic and emotion. This work of Nietzsche is a very useful tool with which to examine why porn is so appealing. The logical side of us recognises that watching porn is unproductive — even harmful. That doesn’t matter to us, though. Indeed, Dionysius nods in approval.
<br><br>
I would argue, though, that Nietzsche’s explanation is incomplete. I think there’s more to why we watch pornography. Porn is an outlet to fantasise, an outlet to express and see expressed only the very strongest emotions, which we otherwise fail to communicate in a society that so heavily prizes reserve and restraint. Humans see more than what’s playing on the screen in front of them; they see all of their most powerful and shameful emotions manifested. To an extent, porn allows people to imagine themselves in those situations: it is the most immersive form of media only because the audience want to be immersed so badly. We use porn to dream of more: more violence, more emotion, more pain, more pleasure. At the risk of sounding too much like (oh God, there’s no other word) an expert, I believe that pornography is an outlet for the emotions we rarely get to express, even in our most intimate moments. In fact, Arthur Schopenhauer, a contemporary of Nietzsche’s and equally famed philosopher, created what’s called the ‘Hedgehog’s Dilemma’. It’s a parable describing how two hedgehogs crave each other’s company, but fail to get close for the risk of impaling the other with their spikes. This philosophical dilemma is a metaphor about the challenges of human intimacy, where humans are doomed to isolation because they cannot avoid hurting one another. This hints at another reason humans love pornography: it showcases a level of intimacy that every human strives towards, but will never attain. We resort to porn to dream about how, one day, we might just be able to.
<br><br>
A short aside: one of the biggest reasons for this dilemma is due to what I like to call the ‘human obsession with permanence’. Romantic novels, films and ideas have historically been associating love with permanence. Words like forever and eternity are thrown around, suggesting that a love can only be real if it lasts until the end of time. This is ironic, given the transitory and generally fickle nature of humans in general. In fact, maybe it’s our awareness of our own transitory nature that makes us treasure permanence so much.  Obsessed with the idea that true love lasts forever, we fear getting truly close to each other lest we ruin the chances of our relationships lasting till ‘death do us apart’. This explains why Schopenhauer was so adamant about the ‘Hedgehog’s Dilemma’. While porn seems to be a popular temporary outlet to forget about this dilemma, it actually exacerbates the problem by only showing the flashy, sexy parts of relationships.
<br><br>
Finally, we watch pornography for exactly the same reason we don’t talk about it. There is a lot of stigma surround pornography and its use. Every time humans feel their fingers typing the letters on their private browser, they feel a deep, visceral gratification: one that is associated with doing something forbidden, something so, so, ‘wrong’. This element of rebellion, the fact that we’re getting away with watching porn — something society says we shouldn’t be doing, something that certainly no-one admits to doing — adds a certain nonconformist appeal to the situation.
<br><br>
Also, (people tell me) it feels very good.
<br><br>
Porn is an industry surrounded by stigma. In public, people cringe at the mention of the word, no matter the context. To the Apollonian masks we put on for the world, the word ‘porn’ connotes primality and lack of restraint, which is disgusting to the rational and restrained people we strive to be in front of others. In a reserved, appearance-based society, the greatest shame is to be known to have succumbed to perhaps the crudest instinct we, as humans, have — the desire to procreate. As time goes on and each generation becomes further removed from our ancestors, we see ourselves slightly differently. Slightly more refined, more advanced. More civilised. We associate porn with our primitive ancestors, as a reminder of a time where society was less sophisticated and more easily victim to its instincts. With each generation, we try and shift ourselves a little bit further away from the Dionysian beast at the core of the human condition. Therefore, any mention of porn doesn’t necessarily foster shame just because it’s graphic or unbecoming, but because of deep insecurities we hold as a people.
<br><br>
Pornographic actors are scorned for life; we see them as beneath us because they worked in the pornographic industry, and so, surely, must be tainted hedonists chasing vices. The word ‘porn’ scars a résumé like no other, ensuring the actors struggle in the future. They struggle to find work after their time in porn, which can be brutal enough in itself. The pornographic industry is often — not always — ripe with abuse, blackmail, violence, addiction and disease. So, why do people do porn? It’s a choice, right? Yes and no. The classic response stating that ‘it’s their decision’ overestimates the degree of choice many adult actors face in the real word. When you need the money, and aren’t fully aware of what you’re getting into because of distorted perceptions about the industry, it’s easy to find yourself in a tricky situation. It can also be difficult to leave because of psychological abuse, threats of violence, or most importantly, the difficultly of actually finding another job afterwards. The stigma around these actors is, in my opinion, mostly undeserved, but also will not change anytime soon.
<br><br>
How about us, the consumers, though? Is it wrong to watch porn? Immanuel Kant, arguably one of the greatest philosophers of all time, would say so. Kantian ethics argue that it is morally wrong to harm someone else because they are a sentient, rational being in themselves. Given that porn is generally agreed to be harmful to the person watching it (when taken to an extreme extent), we are harming ourselves by watching pornography. Kant would suggest that since we, too, are sentient, rational beings, anything we do to harm ourselves is morally wrong. Suicide, self-harm, and laziness would all fall under this category. Following this argument in its strictest sense, watching pornography would be, too. Kant would posit, on this basis, that watching porn is wrong. I disagree, and I think many people would too, pointing out that self-ownership to do what we choose and our own autonomy are more central to our identity as ‘sentient, rational beings’ than the traits quoted in his moral argument. Note that my disagreement extends only to the ‘harming’ of oneself, and not of others.
<br><br>
I deliberately choose not to include any numbers on any of this, mainly because any ‘studies’ done trying to quantify the negative effects of watching porn struggle to find a valid way of proving causality over correlation, and their experimental methods linking porn and violent crime, misogyny and rape are questionable, at best.
<br><br>
A few years ago, there was a major media scandal over the leaked explicit photographs of some celebrities. Since this was trending for such a long time, and is a corollary to our main question of whether it’s wrong to look at pornographic videos, let’s examine the question of whether it’s wrong to look at leaked nude images, too. The consequentialist would argue that people suffer when they have their autonomy overridden, like someone does when you look at a revealing picture of them without their consent. Kant would agree, but adding that it’s morally wrong even if you don’t cause them any suffering. I don’t fully agree with this last premise that it’s wrong even if you don’t cause anyone suffering, but I do agree with the conclusion that it is wrong to look at such photos. The most popular argument against this is that if the victim didn’t want anyone to look at these photos, they shouldn’t have sent them to anyone in the first place. They knew there was a risk of them being leaked, so it’s their fault, right? This is a grave misattribution of responsibility. Imagine you were the owner of a gun shop, crafting high quality firearms for your loyal customers, and making a profit in turn. One day, you sell a handgun to a client you’ve known for a long time, and they promptly proceed to shoot you in the head. Is it your fault? No. But you did know the possibility of you getting shot existed when you handed them the gun. Still not your fault. In a similar way, the person taking the nude photo shouldn’t be blamed — much — for a crime they didn’t commit. In reality, I would suggest that they should bear a small part of the responsibility; the gun analogy fails to recognise the ease with which someone can spread a private photo, and also falsely equates the motives for each of the two acts.
<br><br>
Having understood some common philosophical arguments surrounding the morality of porn, let’s tackle the question of objectification and gender roles. A routine argument made is one suggesting that porn encourages the objectification of women. Huffington Post looked into this and concluded that women are indeed often seen as objects of male sexual pleasure because the vast majority of pornographic videos only depict male orgasm. They also noted, though, that in most reviewed scenarios men and women had equal social power, and were equally likely to initiate sexual encounters. Note that they also found it was common for male faces to be excluded from the explicit material. On this front, one could argue that men are objectified just as much as women, just in a different way. Another major argument is that pornography is bad because it encourages violent treatment of women. In the same Huffington Post study, explicit sexual violence was present in a surprisingly small amount of pornographic content, as low as 3%. I would argue that if there is any imbalance of power between men and women in porn, or any aggressive attitudes towards women in porn, is a product of attitudes present in society at large, not just porn. As such, they are not unusual, in the strictest sense of the word. What’s undeniable, however, is that men tend to be the driving forces of sexual pleasure and the dominant one in any sexual encounters on film. Why is this? It could be reflective of the biological differences between sexes, and may arise from the fact that increased male muscle mass allows for a man to physically dominate a woman, in both ways sexual and not. This raises questions about whether this dynamic is inbuilt into humans, and whether it’s something societal pressure can force out. While we’ve seen that there is some merit to the contention that porn objectifies women, it’s worth noticing that countries with the most liberal attitudes towards sex and porn also tend to have stronger feminist groups and women’s rights laws. This is probably correlation and not causation, though, as most countries liberal about sex and porn are very developed, and thus it follows they treat women as they do men.
<br><br>
The phrase women most often search on adult websites is ‘lesbian’. Despite an overwhelming majority of women identifying as heterosexual, this term pops up again and again in different contexts. Perhaps it hints at women being more open to experimentation, perhaps it suggests that women are more shy and ashamed of their homosexual urges than men. Or perhaps this indicates women, in general, are more comfortable with those of their own sex than are men. It’s dangerous to make sweeping statements like that, though, as pornographic fantasies are not a terribly good metric to measure real sexual preferences. For men, ‘MILF’, ‘step-mom’ and ‘step-sister’ were all highly searched. This is very telling about male sexuality. The fact that men most often have sexual fantasies about their relatives may hint at an underlying psychological phenomenon at play, whereby they see sexual relations and family life as very distinct and non-overlapping ideas, and meshing the two ideas is a ‘taboo’ and ‘forbidden’ combination they like to explore through porn, as discussed earlier.
<br><br>
Another lens through which to think of the differences between gender is Schopenhauer’s concept of love. Schopenhauer saw love to be the individual manifestation of the human desire to procreate. He saw women as biologically inferior to men, saying that they are, by nature, more suited to homely jobs. His sexist beliefs served as a basis for arguments that laid the foundation for modern feminist schools of thought. Schopenhauer’s thoughts on women can also be a useful tool with which to analyse pornography, though. Maybe Schopenhauer is right, and we see men treat women the ways they sometimes do on pornographic films because that attitude is a natural one to have given the biological differences between sexes. I’m more optimistic, though, and disagree with Schopenhauer’s reductionist view on the concept of love. His beliefs that the separate roles of men and women in the human reproductive process do go a long way in explaining the ways men and women interact in porn, though. Perhaps his misogynistic views are central parts of the Dionysius inside all of us males, and maybe that’s why we watch pornography the way we do.
<br><br>
The way humans use pornography says a lot about our culture, societal pressures, and gender imbalances. In the end, watching pornography is controversial for good reason. But porn isn’t inherently wrong, and it shouldn’t be seen that way. It can be healthy as a supplement to relationships, and it can even be helpful for society to give a nod to the Dionysius inside us all. There’s a lot wrong with the pornographic industry, where adult actors are often victims, lacking the ‘choice’ many people think them to have. While porn can propagate sexism and disease, our primitive roots as humans also mean that pornographic content will always be around. I thus propose regulation: we encourage and introduce ‘ethical’ pornography, carefully filmed to avoid sexually transmitted disease, objectification of either sex, with clear guidelines, rules and consent — a wanker’s code, of sorts. Watching any other type of porn promotes and creates a demand for all the things wrong with the industry. Just because we’re wankers doesn’t mean we have to be assholes. I think Nietzsche, Kant and Schopenhauer would agree.

<h3>Untold Stories; A Study on Humanity</h3>
<p class="notop">
<i> This was an essay I wrote for a competition while in high school, and it eventually led me to speak at Westminster Abbey on the same topic. </i><br><br>

Thick, conspicuous black frames sat atop his nose, just about covering the bottom half of his bushy olive eyebrows. His temple hinted at acne. The rest of his face was smooth, yet coarse with fatigue. He wore a long sleeved t-shirt, though it was slightly too short to fully cover his pastel white arms. James was an average twenty eight year old guy. It was tiring, what he was doing — he’d spent the better part of the last three hours chipping away at a PowerPoint about the firm’s revenues and projected growth. But he was nearly finished. Afterwards, he would go to the pub and join his three closest friends for a pint while watching the Six Nations. A little smile flickered across his face as his fingers pressed ctrl+S for the last time. A deep sigh. A yawn. He closed his laptop, took another sip from the paper cup of hot chocolate on his right, and began packing away his papers. Sometimes, he didn’t understand why he was making these PowerPoints; they achieved nothing. He questioned what his role as a ‘Digital Growth Specialist’ even meant, or how his degree in Geography was helping him. It’s okay, though. He wasn’t paid to ask silly questions like that. And, as long as he got paid at the end of the month, all was good. He got up, slung his blue rucksack over his shoulders, and walked back to his studio, a few hundred meters away from the café he was working out of. It had been a long day. Thank god he could crack a cold one with the guys and relax. It’s not easy doing work on Sundays. That wasn’t his job. A soft, simmering yellow sun began to set, and sleepy clouds drifted above as evening set in. James went to the pub, had some fags, a few pints, and lots of laughs. The next day, he went to work as usual. <p></p>

The mirror was stained with his younger sister’s attempts at using make-up, but Joshua could still see himself fairly clearly. His mum told him he looked handsome in his new grey blazer. She had sown it for him herself; his family could never afford to buy something like that. His white shirt was spick and span. Tucked in and wrinkle free. Ready for his first day of Year 9. His chiselled features and stark brown-green hair juxtaposed his otherwise pale skin and fragile frame. Joshua felt butterflies gnawing away inside him. When he arrived at school, his classroom was brimming with the quintessentially awkward chit-chat that characterises the first day at a new school.<p></p>

A few months in, Joshua’s parents were told that Josh was one of the top students in the year, and that he should start to think about setting his sights at top unis. His Geography teacher, especially, noted him to be one of the brightest students she had seen in fourteen years of teaching. His parents weren’t particularly ambitious, they didn’t mind what he wanted to do, or to be — as long as he was content. But Joshua already knew where he was going. He took pride in being unapologetically ambitious — he would go down in history. A thousand years from now, they would study him in class. He didn’t quite know what exactly he’d end up doing, but he knew he’d be the greatest that ever did it. What Josh just couldn’t understand, though, was how his fellow classmates could be so placid in everything they did. So willing to accept mediocrity. He could never accept being average. He would never be average. He would go to Oxford, then work for the government. Maybe then he’d run for Prime Minister or something like that. He’d make a great Prime Minister.<p></p>

Patricio was on the night shift today. His slight belly pooch made tying up his apron rather difficult. Ever since his friends mocked him when he was young, Patricio was somewhat insecure about his weight — you’d never be able to tell, though. He put on his hairnet removing only a few strands of jet black hair in the process. He had a wide frame — chubby but built, a tad under six foot. Bright red double deckers whistled past outside, just hearing the icy wind stir outside made him shiver. The restaurant was packed tonight. Men in dark blue suits fresh from Canary Wharf were gossiping in the corner, salsa dripping from their mouths; a loud group of teenage boys, pants hanging unforgivably low, chattering around the table in the middle, sharing a large bowl of tacos. It wasn’t usually this busy on a Saturday night. A young couple approached the counter, he gave them the standard smile: ‘Welcome to Chipotlé, what can I get you today?’. Five minutes and two burritos later, the girl paid by card, giggling with her boyfriend at her ear, his hands tickling her playfully. Patricio picked up the broom, and went to the corner to clean up after some customers, smirking as he saw a student not too much younger than himself, struggling with his Physics homework on the screen of his laptop in the corner of the restaurant. Patricio couldn’t help but bounce a little bit, the soft Mexican music in the restaurant was electric. He felt warm inside. It continued to snow softly, late into the night. <p></p>

Páchá could not, for the life of him, figure it out. He had been stuck on the same damn trigonometry problem for three hours now. Study Mechanical Engineering at Université Centralé and you’ll be set for life, they said. Pfft. So much for that. The shadows danced across his table as the chandelier above swayed gently in front of the candle illuminating his room. It was a quiet night. Eerily so, in fact. He heard dissonant sounds whispering in the distance. Sirens, rising. His mother burst into his room, breaking the door off one of its hinges, screaming. Her cheeks were wet with angst and eyes black with fear. <p></p>

<i>Páchá! Empaca tus cosas, tu padre dice que nos estamos yendo ahora, el conductor está esperando afuera, por favor, date prisa o vamos a morir malditamente. Cristo sálvanos!</i><p></p>

<i>[Páchá! Pack your stuff, your father says we're leaving right now, the driver is waiting outside, please, hurry or we're all going to die! Christ help us!]</i><p></p>

He did what she said. Stunned, Páchá grabbed his laptop, threw some clothes into a small suitcase and leapt over what remained of the door, jumping down the stairs four at a time. As he ran into the car, it began accelerating before he could close the door. A little time later, he sat in the back left seat of the car, his mother convulsing, sobbing, in his arms. He still didn’t know what was going on, where they were going, or why they were leaving everything behind. Increasingly, he felt as if he wouldn’t want to find out. His father sat in front, stoic as always, looking straight ahead. But he could see the red in his fathers eyes, and the dried tears lacing his nose. Through the rearview mirror, he saw fire, blazing in the distance behind them.
<p></p>

She moaned, stretched her hands out high, and let them drop, plopping softly onto her duvet with a light thud. Her alarm urged her to leave her kingdom of comfort and get ready for another day of work. Slipping into her fluffy velvet slippers, Hillary made her way to her toilet, a couple of metres away, flicked the soft yellow light on, and looked at herself blankly. Eyes flickering sheepishly, her hair was a mess and her oversized pyjama top about to fall off. All was good after a warm shower. Thank god the hot water had worked. She dried, combed, and did her hair, padded chocolate brown foundation onto her dark skin, leaned close to the mirror to make sure to get all the blemishes, and threw on her freshest pair of bright violet scrubs. On the way to the operation theatre, she took phone calls, as well as some caffeine pills. As always, Hillary had made sure to do her reading on the operation she was scheduled to do today. That said, the day’s operation was to be a fairly routine one: a standard gastric bypass. In Harlesden, she had made a name for herself. All sorts of people — addicts, office workers, the homeless and senior citizens alike came to her for major medical procedures. It made no difference to her, though — the laws of human anatomy worked the same for all of them. Two and a half hours later, she was in the middle of the bypass on a teenage girl who was incredibly overweight. Under the watchful eye of a sterile blue lamp she grit her teeth in silence, frustrated at her inability to tie up a stitch. Hillary continued fingering her way around the girl’s stomach, eventually tying the operation up cleanly. She was satisfied, and stared at her work for a few seconds, admiring the symmetry and raw beauty of the workings of the human body. Her nurse snapped her out of it, thrusting some documents to be filled out in front of her. That was all for the day. After a short drive home, Hillary stripped off her scrubs, damp socks, let loose her hair, unclasped her bra and dipped into the same set of comfy pyjamas she had woken up in. A few minutes later, she was curled up with day-old Chinese take-out in hand, and the most recent episode of Britain’s Got Talent on her laptop in front of her.
<p></p>

She had always been a suspicious child; Harriet knew something was up when she started seeing less and less of her mama. Every night, her mother used to sit by her bed side, arm in hand, and tell her about her own childhood — stories of adventures, exploits from when her mother was a child being raised in rural Ghana, where the family had come from. Harriet couldn’t relate to any of it of course; she was surrounded by picket fence and green grass, not dead shrubs and barbed wire, but it sounded fantastical and magical anyway. Her mama stopped doing that a few weeks ago, though. But Harriet didn’t want to complain — she was a big girl now, a seven year old shouldn’t need her mama tucking her in every night. She was short, even for her age, and her French plat and bubbly gait did nothing to make her look any older. She came back from school one Wednesday evening bursting to tell papa about how well she did in her science quiz. She did very well, indeed. But just before she dug into her alphabet soup, papa asked her to come to the living room. For reasons she couldn’t explain, she felt anxious. She had never seen papa so serious. Maybe he didn’t have a good day at work. Armed with nothing but a violet Barbie school bag — violet had always been her favourite colour — and a fiery desire to find out what’s going on, she plonked herself down on an armchair far too big for her facing her mother and father, who sat on the sofa opposite her.
<p></p>

‘Harriet, honey, we’re going to tell you something that might make you a little sad.’ her father swallowed, struggling to keep his composure.
<p></p>

‘Ok.’ suggested Harriet, pupils wide, ripe with innocence.
<p></p>

‘Mama is going to go away for a while.’ papa said. He held mama’s arm in his hand, squeezing it reassuringly.
<p></p>

‘Where?’ asked little Harriet.
<p></p>

‘Far away, to a better place.’ mama whispered. Mama started crying; Harriet couldn’t understand why. It was making her very sad.
<p></p>

‘When will mama come back?’ Harriet asked, her lips twitching, about to burst into tears.
<p></p>
‘She won’t.’
<p></p>
<p></p>
Before I help you, the reader, make sense of this little experiment, I urge you to consider whether you know a James, or a Patricio, or a Hillary. I’m sure you do — perhaps a colleague you meet regularly at the pub, maybe the pleasant young man who serves you every Saturday at your local Chipotlé. Conceivably a surgeon who operated on you once, and to whom you are forever grateful.
<p></p>
Really, I implore you: think about these people you know so well.
<br><br>
James, the white-collar young man, went on to die at the age of 63 from liver failure. He lived a contented man who knew his place. Sometimes, his sister missed him. His parents didn’t mourn. They were dead too. Few came to his funeral, and fewer still ever remembered him after his time was up. An average man, through and through.
<br><br>
What you don’t realise, though, is that Joshua, the ambitious kid who told himself he would go down in history grew up to be James. They are, quite literally, the same person being described under different names. A visionary young boy, full of promise, tempered by the twin hammers of familial and societal pressures. It’s surreal to think that people we think we know so well could have been anything — or anyone — in the past, and we would never be able to tell. Joshua grew up, studied Geography at Oxford, and got a comfortable job at a marketing firm where he worked for the rest of his life. It’s ironic, almost.
<br><br>
Patricio, the enthusiastic latino waiter at Chipotlé, was not always who you think. Just five weeks earlier, he was Páchá, a second-year university student studying engineering at the most prestigious university in Venezuela. Then, he fled for his life, alongside his family, from the political turmoil that the country had been thrust into. Now, he has a place to study Physics at the University of Nottingham, and is working at a fast-food restaurant in central London to accrue some money to pay his university tuition. His Venezuelan qualifications aren’t recognised in the UK, and he is therefore being forced to start university again. He’s optimistic though; he hopes to get a doctorate in Computer Science, and contribute to the field of Machine Learning.
<br><br>
Hillary, the bariatric surgeon who works to make her community a better place, hated science as a child. She would never have become a doctor if her mother hadn’t died of Myeloid Leukemia, an exceedingly rare cancer of the bone marrow. Yes, Harriet grew up to become Hillary; they’re the same person being described under two different names. The death of her mother shook her, and broke her in the years that ensued. She swore to herself she wouldn’t let others ever feel the same way, and pursued Medicine to help those in her community in Harlesden, a deeply underprivileged area.
<br><br>
Is this a work of fiction? No. After meeting and getting to know the man who I’ve described under the pseudonyms of Patricio/Páchá while doing my Physics homework at a Chipotlé, I was disturbed by how little I knew about London, its people, and their stories. So, as I’ve explored London, from Southwark to Camden to Notting Hill and beyond, I’ve taken it upon myself to approach exactly seventeen people on the streets of London, asking them about their lives. Some told me to piss off, others were more than happy to share their stories, where they came from, how they got here, and what they want from London, and from life. James/Joshua is the father of someone I talked to at length; Hillary/Harriet is a woman I shared an hour’s train ride with. These three agreed to have their stories shared with you if I kept them anonymous. As such, none of the names are real. But their stories are perhaps a little too real. To Westminster pupils, and to myself: this is what the world looks like. These are real people, going through experiences that wouldn’t seem out of place in a work of fiction. And they are all around us.
<br><br>
I’m not writing this to comment on these peoples’ lives, but to use these stories are tools to guide us towards a better understanding of the world, and a better understanding of each other. We’re all threads; threads running across a tapestry of delicate stories that comprise the human narrative. We’ll never be able to appreciate the magnificent scale of the human race, but we can certainly come closer than we are now. And we can do that with each other, with those we see everyday. We go through life forming superficial, transient relationships. But we don’t have to. Just as you knew nothing about the past lives of James, of Patricio, of Hillary, you likely know even less about your colleagues, your friends, your family.
<br><br>
Thus, I ask you — I beg you — to find out a little more about the people you think you know. They might shock you. Spend an extra few minutes talking to the cashier at Tesco about how his children are doing, ask your teachers more questions than you think is fair, push to learn more about the circumstances from which your own parents were borne. Maybe even nudge the person sitting next to you on the tube tomorrow morning, and strike up a conversation.
<br><br>
No, actually, don’t do that last one. That’s just annoying.<br><br>

<h3>Yehong Zhu--Star Crossed--Analysis</h3>
<p class="notop">
<i> Yehong Zhu is a writer who often writes on Quora. I thought her writing was particularly stunning, and so will often break down and analyse her prose myself.
I will include the title of the piece in every analysis. You can find the pieces I'm analysing<a href="https://www.yehongzhu.com/writing"> on her website. </a></i><br><br>
<ul>
    <li>starting sentences with a verb (winded)</li>
    <li>power of simile comes from specificity, even if it’s not relatable</li>
    <li>expand your vocabulary to be able to use words like “sardonic” sparingly, but with flair</li>
    <li>use metaphors and then extend them over several sentences: <i>Right before landing in Belgium, you marvel at the setting sun’s Midas touch. How easily it washes the heavens in gold.</i></li>
    <li>really think about how you want to describe an image to bring it to life before you write about it—relive it in your mind before even starting to think about describing it: <i>Two years had passed and yet he sported that same burnished tan, his glance searching and a little uncertain until you beamed in recognition. </i></li>
    <li>Find little phrases that you love as poetic constructs, that indelibly ring in your mind, and note the use of “roguish”, an uncommon and weirdly specific word: <i>In matters of love he was patient and roguish, singular and intense. Being with him feels like the slowest of surrenders, the kind you want to relive over and over again.</i></li>
    <li>a lot of the meaning of words and the feelings they evoke are derived from how it sounds to pronounce them—I don’t even know what “coquettishly” means but somehow I can still feel the connotations it’s intended to evoke</li>
    <li>SUFFUSED = spread over/imbued/permeated “drinks were suffused with nostalgia”</li>
    <li>sustained use of a metaphor (in this case, about drinking/alcohol/intoxication) is powerful, touched on again and again— <i>Drinks that summer were sweeter than you remembered, suffused with nostalgia, imbibed in the hazy diffused glow of a million city lights. You are young and immortal and living in Manhattan. You are drunk on possibility, and nothing in the world can bring you down. On a rooftop bar by the seaport, Matthias is toying with his mojito, puckering his mouth at the lime. </i><li>a useful detail to touch on is the edges of things—the edges of someone’s accent, someone’s smile, someone’s thoughts. it really adds a sense of specificity and detail to a certain description. </li>
    <li>IMBIBE = drink alcohol OR absorb, assimilate, digest</li>
    <li>SPRITZ = spray something in short bursts</li>
    <li>when drafting, take every sentence and make each word more specific. for example, note how each phrase in each sentence in the following is very, very, specific, as if they were under trial under oath to recount each minute detail in their mind. Instead of saying (before you quit ballet): <i>Before you fractured your fibula on a poorly landed grand jeté, putting your pointe shoes in the closet forever.</i></li>
    <li>A lot of good writing comes from genuinely experience a vivid emotion in your mind before you can even attempt to translate it into paper. I don’t think I’d ever felt what she articulates here, but I feel it now as I read her writing, painting a vivid image of a kind, understanding, player after she told him she loves him (note unsurprised vs not as if he were surprised): <i>He looks at you, not unkindly, not as if he were surprised, but as if it were inevitable. Or rather, unoriginal. A compliment he had heard before and was reluctant to accept again. He kisses you gently on the forehead, but says nothing in return.</i></li>
    <li>SCRABBLE = to gnaw, scratch, frantically search for something</li>
    <li>this phrase really describes the deep ache you feel but can’t quite articulate in intense moments: <i>something hot and dark and wordless settles deep inside you</i></li>
    <li>THROES = intense pain during a time of great change;<i> he convulsed against the throes of death</i></li>
    <li>use “as if” to describe how someone or something looks by comparing it to something completely different, random, unrelated, but very specific</li>
    <li>80% of Yehong’s mastery comes from specificity. She imagines a situation several times before writing about it, summons both the most important details and some unimportant ones, and then weaves them together using sustained metaphors that are oh-so-specific that you can’t help but feel like you’re experiencing what she’s describing. For example:<i>You imagine him taking your heart in his hands, still warm and beating from the cavity in your chest, and plunging a carving knife into the aortic valve. You can feel it already, the gasping wound, your blood spurting in red rivulets. Un couteau dans le coeur, as the French would say.</i></li>
    <li>PETER OUT = gradually diminish, decrease, fade</li>
    <li>QUIXOTIC = idealistic, romantic</li>
</ul>

<h3>Yehong Zhu--Sketches of a City (Beijing)--Analysis</h3>
<p class="notop">
  <ul>
    <li>specificity, specificity—she doesn’t say “delicious $1 breakfast”, she says: <i>For less than $1 you can get delicious homemade scallion pancakes with peanut sauce, sausage, vegetables and fried egg rolled together in this glorious crepe-style breakfast.</i></li>
    <li>vocabulary is important because a very specific, intentioned, and received word choice and completely transform a setting in a readers mind. I got a specific image when she outlines a Beijing cafe for artists and Instagrammers, but when she used the phrase pastel pot, and I looked up the colour pastel, it immediately stuck in my mind and I had a very vivid picture.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Yehong Zhu--A Taste of Italy: On Milan, Siena, and Studying Abroad--Analysis</h3>
<p class="notop">
  <ul>
    <li>WANDERLUST = desire to travel, as it says on the tin</li>
    <li>sometimes literally listing things can be a powerful form of imagery. when describing her culinary experience in Beijing, she lists 5 exotic fruits—almost excessively—to force the reader to grapple with exactly what she experienced. </li>
        <li>when going off listing phrases describing an experience, the most powerful ones are ones where the reader has something insanely come to mind; for example, "I’ve swum in shimmering aquamarine waters next to ancient ruins" is more powerful than "I’ve admired priceless pieces of haute couture at the Emporio Armani Silos" since the reader doesn’t have anything specific in mind when you mention “haute couture”. Instead, force a very specific (and intentional) image down the readers throat.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Yehong Zhu--When in Beijing--Analysis</h3>
<p class="notop">
  <ul>
    <li>IMPERIAL = relating to monarchs, royalty, empires</li>
  <li>PROCESSION = number of people or things moving forward in an orderly manner at a parade</li>
  <li>RAVISH = 1) to seize and forcefully take away 2) to be overcome with emotion 3) plunder, rob</li>
  <li>SWANKY = stylishly luxurious and expensive, showy but in an impressive way</li>
  <li>RITZY = similar to swanky, expensive and stylish</li>
  <li>when you’re trying to describe the scale or magnitude of something, don’t describe that directly “a horde of tourists”, instead describe something that indirectly makes people think of the original thing, and the scale of it “a procession of coloured umbrellas pulsing through the colossal doors at the head of the building”. </li>
  <li>Be very thoughtful and careful with your words. misusing a word in a certain context can make the experienced writer doubt your abilities—“Aware of the historical significance of what we were seeing, we were inundated with an underlying sense of wonder”—her misuse of “underlying” makes me question whether she had really mastered her wide lexicon at this stage of her literary development. Most of the time, use simple words, make your prose beautiful with specificity and imagery and structure, not word choice, and sprinkle in exotic words exactly when they’re needed. </li>
    <li>when you’re re-imaging an experience in your head before writing in down, make not of any surprising details. For example: “Many glorious crepes later, we ventured out into the cool, semi-acidic Beijing drizzle, sated, ready to shop”. Use of the phrase “semi-acidic” adds an immense amount of value to the sentence, helping us imagine the pollution levels in the city, and to almost feel what she felt at the time. </li>
      <li>she often couples the principle of triplets with alliteration “contradiction, complexity, and capture” or “tourist treasure trove”. </li>
      <li>WRIGGLING = squirm, writhe, flounder</li>
      <li>when describing Beijing nightlife: “Neon lights spilled into the evening streets, accentuated by the boom, boom of the live artists performing from the open-air bars; dry ice unfurled onto the sidewalks, where promoters hustled to lure you into their respective establishments (each purportedly better than the last); the river glowed with life, Technicolor from the brightness of the boulevard, and when you closed your eyes against the world you felt the pulse of the city beat in your fingertips, and you remembered how good it felt to be young.”</li>
</ul>

<h3>Yehong Zhu--A Tale of Five Cities--Analysis</h3>
<p class="notop">
  <ul>
    <li>using unusual words like "gaggle"</li>
  <li>DISMAY = alarm, shock, distress</li>
  <li>BOURGEOISIE/BOUJEE = flashy and expensive, in a materialistic sort of way</li>
  <li>“strolling through a boulevard of glitter and grime” powerful alliterative contrast at the end</li>
  <li>FRIGID = cold</li>
  <li>RARING = (as a verb) enthusiastic and ready to go</li>
  <li>again, specificity when you least expect it, and when it’s least needed, to paint a clear picture—“the kind of ambition that scares you with its intensity.”
 </li>
    <li>she makes a lot of use of cultural references—french and italian words for romantic emphasis, references to chinese emperors and specific cultural images, to convey more nuance than any one description might otherwise be able to: “Instead of coming to the once-fabled United States, perhaps future émigrés will come to China to stake their fortunes instead.”
 </li>
  <li>instead of being explicit when describing Cambridge, and saying she had dinner by the candlelight, and maybe describing the exotic silverware and pretentious crockery, she combines both into one image an a clean fell swoop—“Candlelight bounces off the silverware in the hush before the fellows are seated.” </li>
      <li>HALLOWED = holy, sacred</li>
      <li>again, unusual specificity is the cornerstone of her writing—and it’s the sort of specificity that makes you think she’s literally describing off an image of Oxford in front of her, but really she’s describing from an equally clear image stamped into her mind’s eye. “The dining hall is dark and hallowed, with vaulted ceilings and long mahogany tables.”</li>
    <li>KEYSTONE/CORNERSTONE = foundational/important/distinguishing quality or feature of something</li>
      <li>she uses a lot of specific adjectives—types of clothes, shades of colours, and more. I guess this falls under “an extensive vocabulary”. The word “plaid cloth” is much more incisive and powerful (to those who know what it means) than “checkered or tartan twilled cloth”, which is what it means. use “maroon” and “plaid” and “mahogany” to describe things, places, people, rather tan their definitions. again, this only comes with a vast lexicon. </li>
        <li>sometimes—read: SOMETIMES, read: SPARINGLY—you can use phrases simply because they sound good. Literally, because they sound elegant and make your writing seem poetic—as long as they don’t look out of place. This is because most people aren’t reading as deeply or critically as you might think—just glossing and getting the superficial meaning out of what you’re writing, and so a phrase like “bleeding from my ribs” as a method of conveying that you didn’t feel at home technically doesn’t make any sense at all if you think about it, but it sounds BEAUTIFUL, and that’s important for the 90% of the readers just glossing over what you’re writing.
</li>
          <li>ABSOLUTION = religious/moral release from sin/guilt</li>
      <li>CONSECRATED = make or declare something as sacred</li>
      <li>HAUTE = fashionably elegant/high class (hate couture/cuisine)</li>
      <li>while writing with a wide vocabulary can be powerful, it should be used with intention and great care. if I, an educated reader, is having to look up words literally every sentence or two, I can’t help but thinking the prose is a little purple. I think her writing, with some words swapped out, and some unnecessarily poetic phrases removed, would be perfect. </li>
      <li>IMPUNITY = exemption from punishment</li>
      <li>SWILL = drink greedily</li>
</ul>
