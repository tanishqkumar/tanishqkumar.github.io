<p class="notop">My attitude towards books has oscillated. When younger, I'd lick my lips, devouring reams and reams of fiction.
  As I grew older and transitioned to non-fiction, I started to question why I was reading at all. I'd reflect on books I'd read,
  books on topics like criminal law or infectious disease, and I'd think about the amount I'd retained. <p></p> Books
  were only worth reading if they pushed your intellectual abilities while reading them, or if you retained most of their contents. I realised
  that most books did neither. And so I stopped reading. <p></p>From the ages of about 14 to 17, I learned by scouring web forums and watching YouTube videos.
  It wasn't much--but it was honest, unpretentious work. <p></p>At 18, hesitantly, as if tasting a broth that had scalded me in the past,
  I started reading again. This time, I read more selective. More intensely. And by that, I mean that I started reading books 3 times each,
  making notes where I disagreed, connecting the content to other things I'd read. I'd type up my notes. Then revisit them.
  Again. And. Again. I was consuming far less material--doing this meant that getting through 2 books a month was a solid achievement. <p></p>
  But despite the fact that I was reading about half to a third as much as others, I was retaining an order of magnitude more.
  I'd make links in conversation and felt myself thinking differently. It was incredible; I haven't looked back since, and am
  convinced the vast majority of people are doing reading wrong. <p></p> The following is a list of books I have read in the last few months, or plan on
  eading in the next few months. At this point, I read almost exclusively non-fiction. The world we live in is as least as
  rich and vivid in it's complexity and nuance as any fictional universe an author could conjure up. The discerning author must excise those
  stories littered throughout our everyday lives, and tease them out into beautiful, compelling prose.
