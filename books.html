<h3>My Thoughts on Reading</h3>
<p class="notop">My attitude towards reading books has oscillated throughout my life. When younger, I'd pace through reams and reams of fiction
  because my parents told me that I should read, and most of the time it wasn't boring. As I grew older and transitioned to non-fiction,
  at about the age of 14 I started to question whether I really was learning much at all. I'd reflet on books I'd read about certain topics;
  say criminal law or infectious disease, and I'd think objectivelly about the amount I'd retained weeks later. <p></p> The honest answer was that books
  were only worth reading if they pushed your intellectual abilities while reading them, or if you retained most of their contents. And reading
  most books did neither. And so I gave it up. <p></p>From the age of about 14 to 17, I gained knowledge by scouring web forums and watching YouTube videos.
  In my opinion--much less pretentious work. <p></p>Then, at 18, I started reading again. This time, I made sure to choose what I read more selectively.
  I started reading books 3 times each, making notes where I disagreed, linking it to other things I'd read. I'd type up my notes. Then revisit them.
  Again. And. Again. I found that I was consuming far less material--doing this meant that getting through 2 books a month was a solid achievement. <p></p>
  But despite the fact that I was reading about half to a third as much as some other people, I was retaining an order of magnitude more
  about what I read. I'd make links in conversation and felt myself thinking differently. It was incredible; I haven't looked back since, and am
  convinced the vast majority of people are doing reading wrong because they can't recall any of what they've read even days after they
  finish reading it. <p></p> The following is a list of books I have read in the last few months, or plan on reading in the next few months.
  At this point, I read almost exclusively non-fiction. I'm convinced the world we live in is as least as rich and vivid in it's complexity
  and nuance as any fictional universe an author could conjure up. It's just up to us to find those stories hidden everywhere in our daily lives, and
  to tease them out into prose.
