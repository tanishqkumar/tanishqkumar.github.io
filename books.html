<p class="notop">My attitude towards books has oscillated over time. When younger, I'd lick my lips and devour reams and reams of fiction.
  As I grew older and transitioned to non-fiction, I started to question why I was reading at all. <br><br> I'd reflect on books I'd read,
  books on topics like criminal law or infectious disease, and I'd think about the amount I'd retained. Books
  were only worth reading if they pushed your intellectual abilities while reading them, or if you retained most of their contents. I realised
  that most books did neither.<br><br> And so I stopped reading. <br><br>From the ages of about 14 to 17, I learned by scouring web forums and watching YouTube videos.
  It wasn't much--but it was honest, unpretentious work. <br><br>At 18, hesitantly, as if tasting a broth that had scalded me in the past,
  I started reading again. This time, I started reading books 3 times each,
  making notes where I disagreed, connecting the content to other things I'd read. I'd type up my notes. Then revisit them.
  Again. And. Again. I found though, that this method lent itself to number chasing. I'd set a topic I wanted to learn about,
  then read lots on it, taking lots of notes. In the end, I found myself racing to read books and understand their material
  more than to make insightful links and answer deep questions I had. Now, I find myself straddling a balance. I see books for what they
  are: a tool. I now set out with a few questions I want answered, and then assess which media will most clinically answer them. Sometimes
  the answer is a book, other times it's a documentary or a magazine article. So I sadly will not be able to end the year with some
  sexy statistic of how I read a book a week, because I think that's ultimately focusing on the wrong goal.
   <br><br> The following is a list of books I have read in the last few months, or plan on
  reading in the next few months.
<br><br>
<h3>Energy, Climate, Environment</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Storms of My Grandchildren: The Truth About the Coming Climate Catastrophe</li>
  Excellent book, written by the world's leading climate scientist. My only criticism is that he pushes his agenda
  of trying to convince the reader the world will end (not too much of an exaggeration, to be fair) a bit much, in an attempt
  to be more dramatic, but he otherwise strikes a wonderful balance between talking about science and policy. I learned
  a lot about climate physics from this book, even if only on a qualitative level. <br><br>
  <li>Energy for Future Presidents</li>
  One of my favorite books on energy so far. Muller is the ideal scientist--he takes a very impartial, truly objective,
  view of climate change--not giving into alarmist rhetoric--and gives advice to politicians from a scientific perspective
   understanding that they have to balance climate/energy needs with economics,
   national security, and more. Recommend unreservedly.<br><br>
  <li>Ten Technologies to Fix Energy and Climate</li>
  Written with a distinctly British voice, but unfortunately by a non-technical person.
  Goodall makes lots of presumptuous claims and speculative predictions about the future without understanding the
  science behind the technologies he forecasts, and turns out to be wrong about almost every prediction he makes (written
  in 2008). Introduces a few cool new ideas like biochar, but otherwise a very bland book. <br><br>
  <li>Garbology: Our Dirty Love Affair With Trash</li>
  A powerful exposé of an oft-too ignored fact: we produce too much waste, and increasingly don't know
  what to do with it. Humes shows how consumerist culture and techno-optimism come together to
  create a problem of waste disposal that can only be solved by reformed culture values and legislative action.
  Well written, and gave me a glimpse of a world I didn't know existed. <br><br>
  <li>Energy Myths and Realities: Bringing Science to the Policy Debate</li>
  <li>Energy and Civilisation: A History</li>
  This straddles
  the boundary between academic textbook and compelling narrative, but will be difficult to parse if you don't have
  somewhat of a technical background. He beautifully blends physics, geology, history, economics and anthropology
  into one clear tapestry depicting the past, and future, of humanity. It's a great way to learn human history,
  from foraging societies to waterwheels to the electricity grid, and makes you reconsider whether technological progress is
  always a good thing for human happiness. There's a lot to unpack here, and I'll publish a more detailed analysis soon. <br><br>
  <li>The Myth of the Oil Crisis: Overcoming the Challenges of Depletion, Geopolitics, and Global Warming</li>
  <li>Feeding the World: A Challenge for the Twenty-First Century</li>
  <li>The Race for What's Left: The Global Scramble for the World's Last Resources</li>
  <li>An Appeal To Reason: A Cool Look at Global Warming</li>
</ul>

  <li>The Smartest Kids in the World: And How They Got That Way</li>
  <li>This is Not a Test: A New Narrative on Race, Class, and Education </li>
<i>Amateurish, tryhard writing, in my opinion. I was looking for a book examining how American public education is broken,
and instead I got a pseudo-autobiography that'd be most useful for someone majoring in African American or Hispanic studies.
The chapters on edtech/pedagogy were a summary
of his opinions, without any factual justification. </i>
<br><br>
  <li><i>Rethinking </i>Education in the Age of Technology: the Digital Revolution and Schooling in America</li>
  Concise, well-researched, and written in plain english, I learned more from these 150 pages than
  I have from almost any other book of similar length. Despite their partisan endorsement of technology in education,
  the authors cover everything necessary to get a good understanding of education technology's potential. <br><br>
  <li>Disrupting Class, Expanded Edition: How Disruptive Innovation Will Change the Way the World Learns</li>
  <li>The Case against Education: Why the Education System Is a Waste of Time and Money</li>

<h3>General Non-Fiction</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Einstein: His Life and Universe </li>
  <li> The Man Who Solved the Market: How Jim Simons Launched the Quantitative Revolution </li>
At first, I didn't like this book because it used a lot of jargon--"sub-prime mortgages" and
"statistical arbitrage strategies" just served to confuse me. However, once I invested the time to learn what all of them meant, this book
was a great exposé of the quant hedge fund space. The book also opened my eyes to the large amount of interplay
between academia and industry (Simons was a tenured mathematician before starting RenTec), and the motivations of philanthropists. <br><br>
