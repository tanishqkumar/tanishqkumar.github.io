<p class="notop">My attitude towards books has oscillated over time. When younger, I'd lick my lips and devour reams and reams of fiction.
  As I grew older and transitioned to non-fiction, I started to question why I was reading at all. <br><br> I'd reflect on books I'd read,
  books on topics like criminal law or infectious disease, and I'd think about the amount I'd retained. Books
  were only worth reading if they pushed your intellectual abilities while reading them, or if you retained most of their contents. I realised
  that most books did neither.<br><br> And so I stopped reading. <br><br>From the ages of about 14 to 17, I learned by scouring web forums and watching YouTube videos.
  It wasn't much--but it was honest, unpretentious work. <br><br>At 18, hesitantly, as if tasting a broth that had scalded me in the past,
  I started reading again. This time, I read more selectively. More intensely. And by that, I mean that I started reading books 3 times each,
  making notes where I disagreed, connecting the content to other things I'd read. I'd type up my notes. Then revisit them.
  Again. And. Again. I was consuming far less material--doing this meant that getting through 2 books a month was a solid achievement. <br><br>
  But despite the fact that I was reading about half to a third as much as some other people, I was retaining an order of magnitude more.
  I'd make links in conversation and felt myself thinking differently. It was incredible; I haven't looked back since, and am
  convinced the vast majority of people are reading wrong. <br><br> The following is a list of books I have read in the last few months, or plan on
  reading in the next few months. At this point, I read almost exclusively non-fiction. The world we live in is as least as
  rich in it's complexity and nuance as any fictional universe an author could conjure up. The great non-fiction writers bear the burden
  of tending to the stories we so often leave trampled underfoot, and teasing them out into resonant, compelling narratives that remind
  us why it's such a privilege for us to be alive.

<i>Amateurish, tryhard writing, in my opinion. I was looking for a book examining how American public education is broken,
and instead I got a pseudo-autobiography that'd be most useful for someone majoring in African American or Hispanic studies.
The chapters on edtech/pedagogy were a summary
of his opinions, without any factual justification. Sad to say this book was neither informative, nor entertaining. </i>
