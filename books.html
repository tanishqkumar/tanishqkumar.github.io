<p class="notop">My attitude towards books has oscillated over time. When younger, I'd lick my lips and devour reams and reams of fiction.
  As I grew older and transitioned to non-fiction, I started to question why I was reading at all. <br><br> I'd reflect on books I'd read,
  books on topics like criminal law or infectious disease, and I'd think about the amount I'd retained. Books
  were only worth reading if they pushed your intellectual abilities while reading them, or if you retained most of their contents. I realised
  that most books did neither.<br><br> And so I stopped reading. <br><br>From the ages of about 14 to 17, I learned by scouring web forums and watching YouTube videos.
  It wasn't much--but it was honest, unpretentious work. <br><br>At 18, hesitantly, as if tasting a broth that had scalded me in the past,
  I started reading again. This time, I started reading books 3 times each,
  making notes where I disagreed, connecting the content to other things I'd read. I'd type up my notes. Then revisit them.
  Again. And. Again. I found though, that this method lent itself to number chasing. I'd set a topic I wanted to learn about,
  then read lots on it, taking lots of notes. In the end, I found myself racing to read books and understand their material
  more than to make insightful links and answer deep questions I had. Now, I find myself straddling a balance. I see books for what they
  are: a tool. I now set out with a few questions I want answered, and then assess which media will most clinically answer them. Sometimes
  the answer is a book, other times it's a documentary or a magazine article. So I sadly will not be able to end the year with some
  sexy statistic of how I read a book a week, because I think that's ultimately focusing on the wrong goal.
   <br><br> The following is a list of books I have read, or plan to read, during my gap year. I plan on continuing to cultivate
   this list at college.
<br><br>
<h3>Energy, Climate, Environment</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Storms of My Grandchildren: The Truth About the Coming Climate Catastrophe</li>
  Excellent book, written by the world's leading climate scientist. My only criticism is that he pushes his agenda
  of trying to convince the reader the world will end (not too much of an exaggeration, to be fair) a bit much, in an attempt
  to be more dramatic, but he otherwise strikes a wonderful balance between talking about science and policy. I learned
  a lot about climate physics from this book, even if only on a qualitative level. <br><br>
  <li>Energy for Future Presidents</li>
  One of my favorite books on energy so far. Muller is the ideal scientist--he takes a very impartial, truly objective,
  view of climate change--not giving into alarmist rhetoric--and gives advice to politicians from a scientific perspective
   understanding that they have to balance climate/energy needs with economics,
   national security, and more. Recommend unreservedly.<br><br>
  <li>Ten Technologies to Fix Energy and Climate</li>
  Written with a distinctly British voice, but unfortunately by a non-technical person.
  Goodall makes lots of presumptuous claims and speculative predictions about the future without understanding the
  science behind the technologies he forecasts, and turns out to be wrong about almost every prediction he makes (written
  in 2008). Introduces a few cool new ideas like biochar, but otherwise a very bland book. <br><br>
  <li>Garbology: Our Dirty Love Affair With Trash</li>
  A powerful exposé of an oft-too ignored fact: we produce too much waste, and increasingly don't know
  what to do with it. Humes shows how consumerist culture and techno-optimism come together to
  create a problem of waste disposal that can only be solved by reformed culture values and legislative action.
  Well written, and gave me a glimpse of a world I didn't know existed. <br><br>
  <li>Energy Myths and Realities: Bringing Science to the Policy Debate</li>
  <li>Energy and Civilisation: A History</li>
  This straddles the boundary between academic textbook and compelling narrative, but will be difficult to parse if you don't have
  somewhat of a technical background. He beautifully blends physics, geology, history, economics and anthropology
  into one clear tapestry depicting the past, and future, of humanity. Surveying human history,
  from foraging societies, waterwheels, to the electricity grid, it makes you reconsider whether technological progress is
  always a good thing for human happiness. <br><br>
  <li>Growth: From Microorganisms to Megacities</li>
  <li>Feeding the World: A Challenge for the Twenty-First Century</li>
</ul>
<h3>Gaming</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Reality Is Broken: Why Games Make Us Better and How They Can Change the World</li>
  Very easy read--first section about why games are so successful and important was useful, but second and third
  sections on ARGs and gamifying real life situations were unconvincing and insubstantive, in my opinion. Otherwise,
  a solid first read about the industry, reaffirming my intutuition that technology is providing a medium through which
   we can cheaply engineer happiness at scale through video games. <br><br>
  <li>Blood, Sweat, and Pixels: The Triumphant, Turbulent Stories Behind How Video Games Are Made</li>
  One-day read; palatable for the layperson but also commensurately shallow. It did leave
   me with a better understanding of game development culture,
  incumbent practises and attitudes, as well as how studios work organizationally and logistically, and the role of
  tech innovation in crafting good gameplay experiences, which is indeed what I was looking for.  <br><br>
    <li>A Casual Revolution: Reinventing Video Games and Their Players</li>
  <li>Inside the Video Game Industry: Game Developers Talk About the Business of Play</li>
  <li>Power-Up: How Japanese Video Games Gave the World an Extra Life</li>
  <li>The Well-Played Game: A Player's Philosophy</li>
</ul>
<h3>Education</h3>
<ul>
  <li>This is Not a Test: A New Narrative on Race, Class, and Education </li>
<i>Amateurish, tryhard writing, in my opinion. I was looking for a book examining how American public education is broken,
and instead I got a pseudo-autobiography that'd be most useful for someone majoring in African American or Hispanic studies.
The chapters on edtech/pedagogy were a summary
of his opinions, without any factual justification. </i>
<br><br>
  <li>Rethinking Education in the Age of Technology: the Digital Revolution and Schooling in America</li>
  Concise, well-researched, and written in plain english, I learned more from these 150 pages than
  I have from almost any other book of similar length. Despite their partisan endorsement of technology in education,
  the authors cover everything necessary to get a good understanding of education technology's potential. <br><br>
  <li>Disrupting Class: How Disruptive Innovation Will Change the Way the World Learns</li>
  Despite lots of hand-wavey arguments and predictions that have
  turned out completely wrong, this book has some important ideas. Centrally, the author asserts that online courses will first be used for classes
  schools don't offer, and then as adaptive learning technologies mature, administrators will come around given the right organisational support (which I doubt will happen). <br><br>
  <li>The Case against Education: Why the Education System Is a Waste of Time and Money</li>
  Engaging and thorough, impressively entertaining criticism to formalize intuitions every student has.
   Reaffirms that formal education involves little useful learning,
  and explains why edtech is unlikely to scale in the near future (but will in the long-run). Taught me a
  lot about how economists think and how truly rigorous social science research is done.
</ul>
<h3>Defense and Military</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The Weapon Wizards: How Israel Became a High-Tech Military Superpower</li>
  <li>Countdown to Zero Day—Cybersecurity</li>
  <li>Cyber Mercenaries: The State, Hackers, and Power</li>

  <li>Tools and Weapons: The Promise and the Peril of the Digital Age</li>
  <li>Army of None: Autonomous Weapons and the Future of War</li>

  <li>The Responsive City</li>
</ul> -->

<h3>Great People of History</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Alexander the Conqueror </li>
  <li> Caesar </li>
  My favorite person of all time. A tyrant towards the end of his life, sure,
  but also known for his clemency and love for those close to him, and for his state. A master
  politician, tactician, philosopher, combat engineer and orator, 5 years in Ceasar's life contain
  more experiences than the entire lives of most other great people. A man who is justifiably remembered
  as a father of western civilisation, and a personal idol of mine. <br><br>
  <li> Leonardo Da Vinci </li>
  A gay, illegitemate, vegetarian who defined independent thinking. Studying Leonardo taught me
  how to appreciate and criticise Renaissance art, as well as what separates the very greatest
  from otherwise legendary figures like Michelangelo, Botticelli, Alberti (hint: it's circumstance).
  This book encourages you to be more curious and value your time more--every second was like liquid
  gold to the Italian masters, and so it should be for us. <br><br>
  </menu>
  <li> The Genius of Shakespeare </li>
  <li> The Life of Isaac Newton </li>
  Newton wrangled quantitative, empirical science as we know it today out of the clouds of
  Aristotlean natural philosophy. Equal parts alchemist, theologian and mathematician, physicist, his mind was characterised
  by obsession and curiosity. For even this quintessential recluse, his rivalry with Hooke and camaraderie with Halley
  sparked his invention of classical mechanics. He was less so the first of the scientists, and more the last of the magicians. <br><br>
  <li> Napoleon: A Life </li>
  <li> Karl Marx: A Nineteenth-Century Life </li>
  <li> Einstein: His Life and Universe </li>
Einstein lived one of the most interesting lives of all time. A physicist, sure, but equal parts a
philosopher and womanizer, someone who had a gentle love for humanity yet was so stunningly an asshole
to those close to him. Beyond his genius, it showcases how many things had to align perfectly for him to
achieve the level of success and celebrity he did--his legend is largely a product of circumstance, with many
equally brilliant scientists being forgotten in his wake.<br><br>
  <li> Churchill: Walking With Destiny </li>
  A thousand-page thriller. Roberts does a top job of weaving narrative with amusing factual detail.
  Beyond Churchill's impressive ability to be playful and inspiring under great pressure, I learned lots about British colonialism,
   both World Wars, the day-to-day lives of politicians, military history, and more. This book made me think a lot about posterity, and
   how our descendents will view modern civilisation--as bickering barbarians or visionary ancestors. <br><br>
  <li> Steve Jobs </li>
  Many others on this list were arrogant, but none conceited like Jobs. He epitomises Silicon Valley hubris: no
  respect for human history or incumbent solutions and unfounded belief in entrepreneurship as a moral imperative.
  I do admire his showmanship, ability to persuade and empower individuals, spellbind audiences
  masterfully, and his consistent life philosophy. A product visionary and world-class businessman, but not a great man of history.
</ul>

</ul>

<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
<ul>
  <li> The Man Who Solved the Market: How Jim Simons Launched the Quantitative Revolution </li>
At first, I didn't like this book because it used a lot of jargon--"sub-prime mortgages" and
"statistical arbitrage strategies" just served to confuse me. However, once I invested the time to learn what all of them meant, this book
was a great exposé of the quant hedge fund space. The book also opened my eyes to the large amount of interplay
between academia and industry (Simons was a tenured mathematician before starting RenTec). <br><br>
  <li> McMafia: A Journey Through the Global Criminal Underworld </li>
I couldn't finish this book. Misha Glenny introduces hundreds of ancillary characters and when describing
webs of illicit activity, the storylines get so unecessarily convoluted that it becomes very tedious to
work through. What I did take away is that crime flourishes in times of political instability, and criminals are all around us,
everyday.<br><br>
  <li> Age of Ambition: Chasing Fortune, Truth, and Faith in the New China </li>
  Engaging and very well written. The Chinese blend of authoritarian capitalism has worked
  wonders for pulling masses out of poverty, but is too constrictive for an emerging middle class to tolerate for much longer.
  Reminded me that China is not a homogenous black box of censorship, but a country full of a billion unique, hopeful
  individuals, vying for their own space to breathe and dream.<br><br>
  <li> String Theory: David Foster Wallace on Tennis </li>
  DFW is one of my favourite writers ever. He writes tons about the most
  trivial and inconsequential details, yet somehow breathes life into them. Equal parts pop-culture and classical references,
  he describes feelings that all tennis players experience, but few have the expository prowess
  (or wherewithall) to put their fingers on.<br><br>
  <li> The Heretics: Adventures With the Enemies of Science </li>
  Mixed feelings. This book certainly did leave me both more understanding of people with "outlandish" beliefs,
  and appreciative of the psychological tricks we play on ourselves. However, it was broad and shallow in scope,
  made strong but unfounded comments about psychology, and fell victim to a purple, try-hard style at the expense of clarity. <br><br>
  <li> The Nordic Theory of Everything: In Search of a Better Life </li>
  <li> Out of Mao's Shadow: The Struggle for the Soul of a New China </li>
